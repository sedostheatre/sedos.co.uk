<h2 id="investment-policy-statement">INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Introduction</p>
<ol>
<li>The Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society (Sedos) is a charitable incorporated organisation (CIO), whose purpose is (i) to educate the public in the fields of dramatic and musical theatre and to further development of public appreciation of and taste in the said fields and (ii) to give the opportunity for persons interested in the fields of dramatic and musical theatre to participate whether on or off stage in theatrical productions of high quality. </li>
<li>Under article 4(5) of the Sedos constitution, Sedos has the power to “deposit or invest funds, employ a professional fund manager and arrange for the investments or other property of the CIO to be held in the name of a nominee, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as the trustees of a trust are permitted to do by the Trustee Act 2000”.</li>
<li>Sedos has an annual income from ticket sales, programme sales, membership subscriptions, and fees for classes and workshops of approximately £100,000 to £140,000. Annual expenditure is approximately £120,000 per annum, allowing for a small annual surplus of approximately £10,000 per annum. Any annual surplus of income over expenditure is applied to the Sedos reserve capital held in an account with Lloyds Bank.</li>
<li>In addition, Sedos has been the beneficiary of the transfer of reserve capital from its predecessor charity vehicle, registered charity 1099443 (‘Old Sedos’). The transfer of funds from Old Sedos occurred when Sedos decided to restructure itself as a CIO. The funds from Old Sedos were made up of corporate charitable donations and an individual legacy request Old Sedos transferred approximately £536,000 to Sedos and these funds have been held as Sedos reserves in a bank account with Lloyds Bank, for any unforeseen expenditure and to support Sedos strategic objective of securing long term rehearsal and performance spaces.</li>
<li>Sedos currently holds no reserves outside the funds held in the Lloyds Bank Account.</li>
<li>The Board of Sedos has determined that the sum of £300,000 should be invested in Rathbones Active Income and Growth Fund. These funds should be invested to grow at least in line with inflation. They are being invested to achieve a return so that they can further Sedos charitable aims. The board has determined that the investment with Rathbones Active Income and Growth Fund should be a financial investment and should achieve the best financial return within the level of risk considered to be acceptable.</li>
<li>The Board of Sedos have determined that the balance of reserves within the Lloyds Bank Account will be transferred to Charity Bank where such funds will be invested to directly further the aims of other charitable organisations, as well as achieving a financial return for Sedos. The balance of funds held in the Lloyds Bank Account will be used for the day to day running of Sedos to achieve its charitable purpose.</li>
<li>The Board of Sedos review investment decisions at regular meetings. Responsibility for day- to day investment management will lie with an authorised professional investment manager regulated by the FCA. This will be on a discretionary basis.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Investment Objectives</p>
<ol>
<li>The Board of Sedos seeks to produce the best financial return within an acceptable, medium level of risk.</li>
<li>The investment objective for the long term investments is to generate a return in excess of inflation.</li>
<li>The investment objective for the short term is to preserve the capital value with a medium level of risk. Assets should be readily available to meet unanticipated cash flow requirements, as well as the anticipated capital expenditure to support Sedos strategic objective of securing long term rehearsal and performance spaces, when such spaces become available.</li>
<li>The Board of Sedos would like to achieve a targeted return of CPI +3% in order to grow assets above inflation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Risk</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Attitude to Risk
Sedos is reliant on legacies and on donations for its activities. Investment assets are held as reserves.</p>
<p>The key risk to the long term reserves is inflation and the assets should be invested to mitigate this risk over the long term. The Board of Sedos understand that this is likely to mean that investment will be concentrated in real assets and that the capital value will fluctuate. It is recognised that in order to achieve the desired growth of the assets, a medium level of risk will be necessary. The Board of Sedos is comfortable with this. The focus of investment should include consideration for lowering volatility.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Assets</p>
<p>Sedos assets can be invested widely and should be diversified by asset class and by security. Asset classes could include cash, bonds, equities, property, hedge funds, structured products, private equity, commodities and any other asset that is deemed suitable for Sedos.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Currency</p>
<p>The base currency of the investment portfolio is Sterling.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Liquidity Requirements</p>
<ol>
<li>Income from the long term investments will be re-invested. If there is a shortfall in income outside the investments, the Board may decide to draw down some of the capital, but this is not expected to be a regular occurrence.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Time Horizon</p>
<ol>
<li>Sedos expects to hold investments for a long term time horizon of 6 to 10 years.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Investment Policy</p>
<ol>
<li>Sedos has adopted an investment policy to ensure that its investments do not conflict with its aims.</li>
<li>As such, Sedos wishes to avoid investments in any companies with a poor environmental record (e.g., recent cautions or convictions for pollution) or in companies who have been sanctioned for human rights abuses.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Management, Reporting and Monitoring</p>
<ol>
<li>Sedos has appointed a professional investment management firm, Rathbones, to manage the assets on a discretionary basis, in line with this investment policy. The Board of Sedos has nominated a list of authorised signatories, two of which are required to sign instructions to Rathbones.</li>
<li>Rathbones will provide the following information on a quarterly basis: valuation of investments and transaction report. Rathbones will also provide an annual report.</li>
<li>The Board of Sedos has responsibility for agreeing strategy and monitoring the investment assets. The Board of Sedos will review the information provided by Rathbones at their meetings. Rathbones will be required to present in person to the Board of Sedos on an annual basis.</li>
<li>Performance of the investments will be measured against inflation +3% after fees over any rolling five year period.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Approval and Review</p>
<p>This Investment Policy Statement was prepared by the Board of Sedos to provide a framework for the management of its investments. It will be reviewed on an annual basis to ensure continuing appropriateness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Approved: 24 February 2020</p>

<h2 id="conflict-of-interest-policy">CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<ol>
<li><p>This policy applies to trustees of the Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society (‘Sedos Trustees’) and sets out guidelines and procedures for identifying, monitoring and managing actual and potential conflicts of interest by Sedos Trustees.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the most general sense, the relevant law says that a Sedos Trustee cannot:</p>
<ol>
<li>benefit from an arrangement or transaction entered into by Sedos, if before the arrangement or transaction was entered into, the Sedos Trustee did not disclose their interest to all of the other Sedos Trustees; and</li>
<li>accept a benefit from a third party conferred by reason of being a Sedos Trustee or by reason of doing (or not doing) anything in their role as a Sedos Trustee unless the acceptance of the benefit cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>If there is an actual or potential conflict of interest for a Sedos Trustee, it needs to be declared and dealt with in accordance with this policy, the Sedos Constitution and the relevant law. In addition, if it is determined that a transaction gives rise to a conflict, then the transaction needs to be authorised by the Sedos Trustees before that transaction proceeds. It should be noted that this does not apply to a reimbursement by Sedos to a Sedos Trustee (or payment by a Sedos Trustee out of Sedos’ funds) of expenses properly incurred by the Sedos Trustee in the performance of any of Sedos’ functions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In this policy, references to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>&quot;conflicts&quot; or &quot;conflicts of interest&quot; include actual and/or potential conflicts of interest and/or duty;</p>
</li>
<li><p>persons who are &quot;connected&quot; with a charity trustee means:</p>
<ol>
<li>a child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, brother or sister of a charity trustee;</li>
<li>the spouse, unmarried partner or civil partner of a charity trustee or of any person falling within paragraph (i) above;</li>
<li>any person who is in a business partnership with a charity trustee or any person who is in a business partnership with any person falling within paragraph (i) or (ii) above; and</li>
<li>any company, business, trust or organisation in which a charity trustee (or any other person connected to them) has an interest as a beneficiary or through ownership, control or influence.</li>
</ol>
<p>If in doubt about whether a person is connected, a Sedos Trustee should seek external advice from a solicitor or other person qualified to advise on the matter; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;benefit&quot; includes any payment or material benefit (including property, loans, goods and services), other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The Sedos Constitution (at Section 7) sets out some procedures in relation to conflicts of interest. This policy should be read in conjunction with the Sedos Constitution and relevant provisions in the Sedos Constitution take precedence over this policy. </p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>THE PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY</p>
<ol>
<li>Sedos Trustees have a personal duty to act in the best interests of Sedos. This means that they must not place themselves in a position where they have, or may have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts with their duties as a Sedos Trustee and must not profit from their position as a Sedos Trustee.  The Charities Act 2011 and Charitable Incorporated Organisations (General) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/3012) also set out some specific duties and responsibilities in relation to conflicts of interest.</li>
<li>Conflicts of interest can inhibit open discussions and may result in Sedos Trustees taking irrelevant considerations into account or making decisions that are not in Sedos’ best interests. They can also damage the reputation of Sedos if it appears that Sedos Trustees are influenced by personal interests or loyalties. All Sedos Trustees must therefore be alert to the possibility that they, or other Sedos Trustees, could be affected by a conflict of interests. </li>
<li>The procedures in this policy will enable Sedos Trustees to identify and manage conflicts of interest so that they can ensure that conflicts do not prevent them from making decisions in the best interest of Sedos. The policy will also help protect Sedos and the Sedos Trustees from any appearance of impropriety in cases where conflicts of interest arise.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>IDENTIFYING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A conflict of interest is any situation in which a Sedos Trustee's direct or indirect interests could, or could be seen to, prevent them from making a decision only in the best interests of Sedos.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Conflicts of interest may arise:</p>
<ol>
<li>where a Sedos Trustee (or a person connected to them) stands to obtain a benefit from Sedos; or</li>
<li>where a Sedos Trustee has a duty of loyalty to a third party that conflicts with their duty to Sedos.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>When considering if they have a conflict of interest, a Sedos Trustee must be aware of the following principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>a conflict of interest exists if there is a possibility that the Sedos Trustee's personal interest could influence their decision-making, even if the Sedos Trustee's decision-making is not in fact adversely affected by the conflict. A reasonable perception that a conflict of interest exists can be enough for a Sedos Trustee to be in breach of their duties; and</li>
<li>the interest that gives rise to a conflict may be direct or indirect and, in particular, a conflict may relate to the interests of someone who is connected to a Sedos Trustee as well as to their own personal interests.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>It is impossible to set out all situations which may result in a conflict, but they may include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>selling, loaning or leasing Sedos’ assets to a Sedos Trustee (or a connected person);</p>
</li>
<li><p>acquiring, borrowing or leasing assets from a Sedos Trustee (or a connected person);</p>
</li>
<li><p>paying a Sedos Trustee for carrying out:</p>
<ol>
<li>their role as Sedos Trustee,</li>
<li>a separate paid post at Sedos (even if they have resigned as a Sedos Trustee); </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>paying a Sedos Trustee (or a connected person) for providing a service and/or goods to Sedos; </p>
</li>
<li><p>employing a person connected to a Sedos Trustee at Sedos;</p>
</li>
<li><p>making a grant to a Sedos Trustee (or a connected person);</p>
</li>
<li><p>when a Sedos Trustee (or a connected person) owes a legal obligation or duty towards another organisation or person (for example, an employer or another charity of which they are a charity trustee) that conflicts with the Sedos Trustee's duty to Sedos;</p>
</li>
<li><p>when a Sedos Trustee has a personal sense of loyalty to another organisation or person that conflicts with their loyalty to Sedos; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>when a Sedos Trustee has religious or political views that could interfere with their ability to make decisions in the interest of Sedos.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>PROCEDURE FOR DECLARING INTERESTS</p>
<ol>
<li><p>All Sedos Trustees have a personal responsibility to declare any interest that might reasonably be regarded as potentially giving rise to a conflict.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On appointment, all Sedos Trustees must complete a declaration of interests form:</p>
<ol>
<li>listing any personal interests, business interests or other direct or indirect interests that might potentially give rise to a conflict of interests;</li>
<li>listing any interests of connected persons that may potentially give rise to a conflict of interest;</li>
<li>declaring any gifts or hospitality received or offered to them in their capacity as charity trustee;</li>
<li>confirming that they are not aware of any conflict, other than those already disclosed, that exists between their role and their personal circumstances or other interests;</li>
<li>confirming that they will update the form annually, or sooner if any changes occur; and</li>
<li>confirming that they will declare any conflict that arises in the future.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The information provided by Sedos Trustees must be recorded in a register of Sedos Trustees' interests (the ‘Conflicts’ Register’). At least once in every 12-month period, all Sedos Trustees must review the information relating to them contained in the Conflicts’ Register and declare that the information is correct or make a further declaration if necessary. </p>
</li>
<li><p>It is for individual Sedos Trustees to decide which matters to declare but, if in doubt, they should make a declaration. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The information provided by Sedos Trustees will be processed in accordance with any prevailing Sedos Privacy Policy, and in any event with data protection principles as set out in the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018. Data will be processed only for the purposes set out in this policy and not for any other purpose.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>MAINTAINING THE CONFLICTS’ REGISTER </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Secretary to the Sedos Trustees will be responsible for maintaining the Conflicts’ Register and will:</p>
<ol>
<li>record in the Conflicts’ Register all conflicts, interests, gifts and hospitality declared by Sedos Trustees; and</li>
<li>circulate amendments or additions to the Conflicts’ Register (if any) to the Sedos Trustees at the start of each Sedos Trustee meeting.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The Conflicts’ Register will be available for inspection by any Sedos Trustee.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>DECLARATION OF INTERESTS BY PROSPECTIVE SEDOS TRUSTEES</p>
<ol>
<li>Before a prospective Sedos Trustee is appointed, they must be asked to declare any direct or indirect interests they have that might give rise to a conflict of interests.</li>
<li>If the Sedos Trustees consider it likely that the prospective Sedos Trustee will be subject to serious or frequent conflicts of interest, the Sedos Trustees should consider whether it is appropriate to proceed with the appointment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>PROCESS FOR DECLARING CONFLICTS</p>
<ol>
<li>The first item on the agenda of each Sedos Trustee meeting will be a standing item requiring all Sedos Trustees attending the meeting to declare any conflicts of interest relating to the matters to be discussed at the meeting.</li>
<li>If a Sedos Trustee considers that they have an actual or potential conflict, they must inform the Chair as soon as possible and always before any discussion of the relevant matter. The declaration must specify the nature and extent of any direct or indirect interest that gives rise to the conflict.</li>
<li>If a Sedos Trustee is aware that another Sedos Trustee has an actual or potential conflict that has not been declared, they must notify the Chair OR the other Sedos Trustees.</li>
<li>If the Chair is declaring a conflict, they must inform the Vice-Chair OR the other Sedos Trustees.</li>
<li>If a Sedos Trustee is uncertain whether or not they are conflicted, they should make a declaration to the Chair OR the other Sedos Trustees.  </li>
<li>The Secretary to the Sedos Trustees must note all conflicts declared in the minutes of the meeting in which they were declared or, if not declared in a meeting, in the minutes of the next Sedos Trustee meeting.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>PROCEDURE FOR ASSESSING CONFLICTS AT MEETINGS</p>
<ol>
<li><p>At the start of each meeting of Sedos Trustees:</p>
<ol>
<li>the Chair must inform the other Sedos Trustees and the Secretary to Sedos of any conflict of interest that has been declared by a Sedos Trustee that relates to the business to be discussed at the meeting; and</li>
<li>the Secretary to Sedos will circulate any amendments or additions to the Conflicts’ Register made since the last meeting of Sedos Trustees.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The way in which conflicts are dealt with will depend on the nature and extent of the conflict. The non-conflicted Sedos Trustees must therefore:</p>
<ol>
<li>assess the nature and extent of the conflict;</li>
<li>assess the risk or threat to decision-making by the Sedos Trustees;</li>
<li>decide whether the conflict is serious (for example, the conflict is acute or extensive, will or may be seen to prevent the Sedos Trustees from making decisions in the best interests of Sedos, relates to a significant decision or risks significantly damaging Sedos' reputation); and</li>
<li>decide what steps to take to handle the conflict.</li>
</ol>
<p>When considering the conflict, the Sedos Trustees must take all relevant factors into account, make decisions only in the best interests of Sedos and always protect Sedos' reputation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The conflicted Sedos Trustee must not take part in any discussion or decision about the conflict and how to handle it and will not be counted in the quorum for that part of the meeting.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The non-conflicted Sedos Trustees must consider whether it is necessary to seek legal advice on whether the conflict is serious and/or on how to manage the conflict declared.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>AUTHORISED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A Sedos Trustee's duty to avoid a conflict of interest does not apply if, and to the extent that, the conflict of interest is authorised by any of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>an express provision in the Sedos Constitution;</p>
</li>
<li><p>a statutory provision, such as the powers in the Charities Act 2011 to:</p>
<ol>
<li>pay a charity trustee (or a connected person) for providing services to the charity (sections 185 to 188); or</li>
<li>take out and pay premiums for trustee indemnity insurance (section 189); or</li>
<li>the Charity Commission or the court.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>In each case, the Sedos Trustee must always follow any conditions that apply to the authorisation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>PROCEDURES FOR MANAGING CONFLICTS</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If the conflict arises owing to a financial transaction between Sedos and a Sedos Trustee (or a connected person), or because a Sedos Trustee (or a connected person) will or may obtain a benefit from Sedos:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>any potential or proposed benefit must be authorised in advance; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>the conflicted Sedos Trustee must:</p>
<ol>
<li>withdraw from all discussions and decisions in relation to the matter; and</li>
<li>not be counted in the quorum for that part of the meeting.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>If the non-conflicted Sedos Trustees decide that a conflict is serious, they must consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>securing the conflicted Sedos Trustee's resignation and/or appointing a new Sedos Trustee who is not conflicted;</li>
<li>not pursuing the course of action that gives rise to the conflict or proceeding in a different way so that the conflict does not arise;</li>
<li>seeking independent, expert advice about how to handle the conflict; and</li>
<li>asking the Charity Commission for guidance.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>If a conflict is not serious, the non-conflicted Sedos Trustees must decide what procedures and level of participation by the conflicted Sedos Trustee are appropriate. A number of steps can be taken to deal with the conflict, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>requiring the conflicted Sedos Trustee to withdraw from the meeting for the relevant item and not to be counted in the quorum for that part of the meeting;</li>
<li>allowing the conflicted Sedos Trustee to remain in the meeting for the relevant item to take part in the discussion, but requiring them to withdraw from the meeting during decision-making and to have no right to vote on the matter; or </li>
<li>appointing a new, non-conflicted Sedos Trustee.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>If the non-conflicted Sedos Trustees decide that the conflict is low risk (in that it will not prevent the conflicted Sedos Trustee from making decisions in the best interests of Sedos), they may agree that the conflicted Sedos Trustee may continue to participate in discussions and the decision-making process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Chair must inform the conflicted Sedos Trustee of the non-conflicted Sedos Trustees' decision about how to manage the conflict.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The minutes of the relevant meeting must include a record of the nature and extent of the conflict, an outline of the discussion and the actions taken to manage the conflict.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Where a Sedos Trustee or a connected person receives a payment or benefit from Sedos, this must be reported in the annual accounts in accordance with the current Statement of Recommended Practice for accounting by charities (Charities SORP).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>ADVISERS AND CONFLICTS</p>
<ol>
<li>Before appointing any advisers to Sedos, the Sedos Trustees must consider whether the adviser has, or may be seen to have, any actual or potential conflict with the interests of Sedos.</li>
<li>Although most advisers will be members of professional or regulatory bodies and will be required to comply with the relevant professional guidelines, some advisers will not be members of such bodies. The terms of appointment of those advisers may therefore need to be modified to include specific provisions relating to conflicts:  </li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>an obligation to inform the Sedos Trustees if any circumstances arise in which they are or may be conflicted; and </li>
<li>an obligation to address any conflicts that arise in the work they do for the Sedos Trustees.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>TRAINING</p>
<p>All newly appointed Sedos Trustees must receive training on this policy and on identifying situations that may result in a conflict and ways in which conflicts can be managed in practice. In addition, charity trustees must be familiar with the principles contained in the Charity Commission's guidance on conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>MONITORING, ENFORCING AND REVIEWING THIS POLICY</p>
<p>Any Sedos Trustee who becomes aware of a breach of this policy must report it to the Secretary to the Sedos Trustees or the Chair as soon as possible. This policy shall be enforced by the Sedos Trustees as a body. This policy shall be made available to members of Sedos via the Sedos website. This policy will be reviewed annually in line with industry best practice standards and all relevant legislation and regulations.</p>

The Management Committee, under the supervision of the Board of Trustees shall ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>BHG is maintained as a COVID-19 Secure Venue;</li>
<li>the Bridewell Theatre and any other space where Sedos Activities take place are COVID-19 Secure Venues for so long as they are being used by Sedos; </li>
<li>this policy and a signed version of this <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5f0810563a6f4004158f18bd/staying-covid-19-secure-accessible.pdf" target="_blank">notice</a> are posted on notice boards in BHG and on the Sedos website; and</li>
<li>clear guidance on social distancing and hygiene is provided to audiences before arrival at any performance, for example by email when purchasing tickets, and on any digital marketing and websites.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bhg">BHG</h4>
<p>For so long as there is no proven effective vaccine for COVID-19 and transmission of COVID-19 remains a risk, no Sedos Activities of any kind shall occur in BHG unless such Sedos Activities comply with the terms of this policy and the prevailing Guidance (other than any activities by suitable authorised persons that are required to make BHG a COVID-19 Secure Venue or otherwise to bring BHG in compliance with this policy or any other HSE policy or law). The maximum number of participants allowed in each space in BHG shall be set by the COVID Compliance Officer from time to time taking into account the prevailing Guidance. On the basis of maintaining social distancing of 2m at all times this shall be a maximum of:</p>
<ul>
<li>14 people for Space 1;</li>
<li>10 people for Space 2;</li>
<li>4 people for the build space (assuming face masks are always used);</li>
<li>1 person for kitchen;</li>

<h3 id="e.activity-by-activity-risk-assessment-and-compliance">E. ACTIVITY BY ACTIVITY RISK ASSESSMENT AND COMPLIANCE</h3>
<h4 id="session-leaders">Session Leaders</h4>
<p>Whenever SEDOS undertakes a Sedos Activity, a separate COVID risk assessment shall be conducted for that Sedos Activity. Whilst the Management Committee will retain overall responsibility for ensuring that all Sedos Activities comply with this policy and the Guidance, a “Session Leader” shall be designated for each Sedos Activity who is delegated responsibility for ensuring the Sedos Activity complies with this policy and the Guidance. The Session Leader shall be a person (or persons) who is responsible for planning and conducting the Sedos Activity and is intended to be present at all or a majority of the in-person meetings for the Sedos Activity. For example, the director or producer of the relevant show or the person running the particular Sedos class.  </p>
<h4 id="activity-plan">Activity Plan</h4>
<p>Before commencement of the Sedos Activity, the Session Leader shall meet with the COVID Compliance Officer or other suitable qualified members of the Management Committee responsible for policy compliance in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>demonstrate they have read and understood this policy and the Guidance; and</li>
<li>set out and agree a plan for ensuring their particular activity will comply with this policy and the Guidance (an “Activity Plan”).</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Management Committee is satisfied that the Activity Plan properly mitigates any general and specific risks and that the Session Leader can reasonably ensure compliance with this policy and the Activity Plan by participants, the Sedos Activity may proceed in accordance with this policy and the Activity Plan. </p>
<p>In considering any Activity Plan where the Guidelines and this policy cannot be followed in full, the Management Committee shall consider whether that Sedos Activity needs to continue, and if so, take any additional actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between participants and audiences.</p>
<p>The Session Leader, with the support of the Management Committee shall be responsible for ensuring that all participants comply with this policy and the Activity Plan. If the relevant Sedos Activity is a show, there may be separate Activity Plans for the rehearsal period and the performance period and the rehearsal period may proceed before the Activity Plan for the performances has been discussed and agreed.</p>
<p>The Session Leader shall also ensure that ahead of commencement of the Sedos Activity, each participant receives the short form “Do’s and Don’ts” list set out in Annex 2. Copies of this list shall also be posted separately and prominently in BHG. </p>
<h4 id="specific-considerations-to-take-into-account-for-an-activity-plan">Specific Considerations to take into account for an Activity Plan</h4>
<p>In developing and implementing an Activity Plan the Management Committee and the Session Leader should consider the following (on a non-exclusive basis):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintaining social distancing wherever possible and reducing as far as possible any time that individuals are not able to maintain social distancing;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Limiting the number of performers as far as possible including conducting rehearsals and training in smaller fixed teams wherever possible;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Limiting the number of audience members, noting that capacity should be maintained at a level that allows social distancing to be maintained;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Limiting the duration of social interaction opportunities at break times as far as possible including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Staggering break times and using safe and separate outside areas for breaks;</li>
<li>Encouraging participants to remain on-site during breaks and, when not possible, maintaining social distancing while off-site;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Encouraging participants to bring as few personal items with them as possible;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Taking steps to encourage audiences to support the overall safety of the event, including discouraging activities which can create aerosol (such as shouting, chanting and singing along), seating individuals rather than allowing them to stand (to help maintain social distancing);</p>
</li>
<li><p>Providing space for performers and other attendees to be socially distanced from each other and from any audience, production team members or other individuals, wherever possible during training, rehearsal, pre-production, performance and any other form of performing arts activity;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Working outdoors where possible. Where this is not possible, ensuring all rehearsal, training and performance areas, with particular regard to indoor and covered areas, have maximum ventilation whenever staff or audiences are present;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Organising and designing auditions, rehearsals, training and performance to avoid situations where performers cannot socially distance, wherever feasible;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adapting live performing arts to ensure they are safe. If that is not possible, consider the use of technology solutions to reduce interactions and ensure social distancing (for example for auditions, rehearsals, production meetings, training and performance);</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using floor tape or paint to mark areas to help people maintain social distance, where possible;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learning lines or parts in advance to avoid carrying scripts in rehearsal;</p>
</li>
<li><p>If performers are likely to spit during their performance, Session Leaders should consider additional mitigations such the use of face coverings or screens;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Performers attending rehearsals and performances only when required for their part and changing the call schedules so that only those required are on-site;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Considering contingency plans if a key performer or other participant becomes unable to participate in-person due to becoming symptomatic;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Where an individual is operating on a peripatetic basis, such as a teacher, director or choreographer, and operating across multiple groups or individuals: </p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining distancing requirements with each group; </li>
<li>Avoiding situations where distancing requirement is broken, for example demonstrating partnering work in dancing; and</li>
<li>Making efforts to reduce the number of groups interacted with and locations worked in, to reduce the number of contacts made;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Take steps to minimise the risk of transmission playing in music groups including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observing social distancing at all times whilst playing.</li>
<li>Using back-to-back or side-to-side positioning (rather than face-to-face) or screens or barriers whenever possible.</li>
<li>Playing outdoors wherever possible.</li>
<li>If playing indoors, limiting the numbers to account for ventilation of the space and the ability to social distance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Structuring auditions in a safe way including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-taping or online auditions to reduce numbers on-site;</li>
<li>Removing waiting rooms where it is not possible to facilitate social distancing, asking people not to arrive ahead of their allocated time slot, and providing clear instruction not to congregate in other areas if waiting;</li>
<li>Using screens to create a physical barrier between people, for example between casting team or accompanist and candidates;</li>
<li>Considering how to appropriately protect any supporting creative team, for example by using screens or ensuring social distancing can be maintained;</li>
<li>Considering the needs of disabled and deaf workers and participants in making adjustments to casting and auditions management;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Taking steps to reduce transmission and maintain social distancing where possible whilst designing and constructing the set;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Taking steps to reduce transmission through contact with objects such as props including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encouraging increased handwashing;</li>
<li>Avoiding sharing personal items such as phones, chargers, pens, and asking owners take responsibility for regularly disinfecting their own personal equipment;</li>
<li>Avoiding sharing professional equipment, music scores, parts and scripts wherever possible;</li>
<li>If equipment has to be shared, regularly disinfecting it and always between users;</li>
<li>Cleaning hire equipment, tools or other equipment on arrival and before first use;</li>
<li>Creating picking-up and dropping-off collection points where possible, rather than passing equipment such as props, scripts, scores and mics hand-to-hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are Activity Plan considerations specific to show performances:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Considering contingency plans if a key performer or other participant becomes unable to participate in-person due to becoming symptomatic;</p>

<h3 id="f.process-after-covid-outbreak">F. PROCESS AFTER COVID OUTBREAK</h3>
<p>Individuals who:</p>
<ul>
<li>have tested positive for COVID-19;</li>
<li>have symptoms of COVID-19 (a high temperature, new and persistent cough or anosmia, however mild);</li>
<li>live in a household or are in a support bubble with someone who has symptoms; or</li>
<li>are advised to self-isolate as part of the government’s <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/" target="_blank">track and trace</a> service,</li>
</ul>
<p>shall not be permitted to take part in Sedos Activities until they have complied with this Section F (each an “Excluded Participant”).</p>
<p>If a participant becomes aware they are an Excluded Participant they should:</p>
<ul>
<li>immediately inform the Session Leader(s) of any Sedos Activity they have taken part in over the previous 10 days;</li>
<li>self-isolate for at least 10 days from when their symptoms started OR if they are not experiencing symptoms but have tested positive for COVID-19 they should self-isolate for at least 10 days starting from the day the test was taken. If they have tested positive whilst not experiencing symptoms but develop symptoms during the isolation period, they should restart the 10 day isolation period from the day they develop symptoms;</li>
<li>if deemed necessary by the Management Committee, obtain the opinion of a doctor that it is safe to return to in-person activities before doing so.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a Session Leader becomes or is made aware of a participant becoming an Excluded Participant they shall immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>inform the *COVID Compliance Officer** by email or phone (details in Section A);</li>
<li>inform all other participants in the Sedos Activity that a participant has become an Excluded Participant; and</li>

<p>Company name: Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society (“SEDOS”)</p>
<p>Completed by: Dan Saunders (Trustee) /Adam Coppard (Management Committee) (“Reviewers”)</p>
<p>Date of next review: January 2021 Date assessment was carried out: 12 September 2020</p>
<p>How was the risk assessment done? </p>
<p>The Reviewers followed the advice at <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/.%C2%A0" target="_blank">www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/. </a></p>
<p>To identify the hazards, they: </p>
<ul>
<li>considered the prevailing government guidance in force as at the date of the assessment; </li>
<li>considered the primary premises that SEDOS operates in (being Brewers Hall Garden and the Bridewell Theatre) and factors that need to be assessed in those locations in order to make them COVID-19 Secure Venues;</li>
<li>reviewed the Bridewell Theatre COVID-19 Risk Assessment current as at the date of the assessment;</li>
<li>considered the needs of those with protected characteristics in making those locations in order to make them COVID-19 Secure Venues’</li>
<li>considered the range of activities that members of SEDOS engage in on a regular basis at SEDOS organised events; and</li>
<li>consulted with members of the Board of Trustees and Management Committee as elected representatives of the membership of SEDOS to obtain input of possible significant risks and the effect of any mitigations.</li>

<p>They noted what was already being done to control the risks and recorded any further actions required. They pinned a copy of the findings on a noticeboard in BHG and published the following risk assessment to the SEDOS website to encourage members to help put the actions into practice. </p>
<p>The Reviewers (or other suitable members of the Board of Trustees and/or Management Committee members) will review the risk assessment whenever there are any significant changes to the government guidance or the apparent risk.</p>

<p><strong>Attending rehearsals, meetings, classes and other activities at Brewers Hall Garden (&ldquo;BHG&rdquo;)</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Traditionally, most of SEDOS&rsquo; activities take place at BHG. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>rehearsals,&nbsp;</li>
<li>classes such as Sedance, Simprov, SeYoga, SeChoir,&nbsp;</li>
<li>set, prop and costume making;</li>
<li>storage of equipment, set and costume; and</li>
<li>production/committee meetings.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Continuing activities at BHG without taking measures to minimise the risk of the transmission of COVID-19 could lead to transmission among members and the people that they come into contact with.</p>
<br />
<p>Opportunities for additional ventilation in BHG are limited creating an increased risk in any tight spaces.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>SEDOS has a COVID-19 policy drafted in line with prevailing government guidelines (the &ldquo;<strong>Policy</strong>&rdquo;) which must be complied with for any activity undertaken by SEDOS and its members, wherever it occurs.&nbsp;</p>
<br />
<p>To promote and police compliance with this Policy in BHG, before any activity is undertaken in BHG a &ldquo;<strong>Session Leader</strong>&rdquo; is appointed who is delegated responsibility for ensuring compliance with the Policy.</p>
<br />
<p>Before commencement of the activity, the Session Leader is to meet with members of the Management Committee responsible for Policy compliance in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>demonstrate they have read and understood the Policy and any relevant government guidance applicable to their particular activity;</li>
<li>set out a plan for ensuring their particular activity will comply with the Policy (an &ldquo;<strong>Activity Plan</strong>&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>If the Management Committee is satisfied that the Activity Plan properly mitigates any specific risks and that the Session Leader can reasonably ensure compliance with the Policy and the Activity Plan by participants, they may proceed with the activity in accordance with the Policy and the Activity Plan and shall be responsible for ensuring that all participants in the activity comply with the Policy and the Activity Plan.</p>
<br />
<p>Without limitation, any activity conducted in BHG shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>adhere to the government guidance regarding non-professional theatre groups at all times;</li>
<li>employ appropriate social distancing for participants in line with the prevailing guidance;&nbsp;</li>
<li>limit the number of participants as far as possible and always within maximum limits prescribed by the government guidance;</li>
<li>limit the duration of social interaction opportunities as far as possible;</li>
<li>use face masks wherever use of face masks does not materially prevent efficacy of the activity;</li>
<li>exclude any person that shows symptoms of COVID-19 or has either shown symptoms or been exposed to a person that has symptoms in the previous 14 days.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>General mitigations measures employed within BHG include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hand sanitiser stations at key locations;</li>
<li>Toilet facilities with anti-bacterial cleaning supplies and single use/non-contact hand drying facilities;</li>
<li>Additional signage encouraging social distancing;</li>
<li>Additional signage encouraging good hygiene practices;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Use of a &lsquo;Track and Trace&rsquo; system; and</li>
<li>Regular cleaning of BHG by third party professional cleaners.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>There are other specific limits and restrictions set out in the Policy. The relevant Activity Plan may have additional limits, restrictions and actions over and above what is set out in the Policy appropriate for that activity.</p>
<br />
<p>The Policy also includes an up to date plan in case there is a COVID-19 outbreak.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performing at the Bridewell Theatre (or any other performance venue)</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>As an amateur dramatics society, SEDOS performs up to 10 shows per year. Shows usually take place at the Bridewell Theatre although other venues are sometimes used.</p>
<br />
<p>Performing in a theatre includes the additional risks (as compared to the risks outlined for BHG above) in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>limited space backstage and in dressing rooms;</li>
<li>potential inability for performers to properly social distance as part of the performance;</li>
<li>the attendance of audience members; and</li>
<li>potential lack of adequate ventilation.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
<p>All SEDOS performances must comply with the Policy and a specific Activity Plan that takes into account the increased risks associated with performing in the particular performance space with a live audience.&nbsp;</p>
<br />
<p>Without limitation, performance activity conducted in the Bridewell Theatre or any other performance space will:</p>
<ul>
<li>adhere to the government guidance regarding non-professional theatre groups at all times;</li>
<li>employ appropriate social distancing for both participants and audience members in line with the prevailing guidance;&nbsp;</li>
<li>limit the number of performers and audience members to be within the maximum limits prescribed by the government guidance;</li>
<li>limit the number of audience members, noting that capacity should be maintained at a level that allows social distancing to be maintained;</li>
<li>limit the duration of performances as far as possible;</li>
<li>take steps to improve ventilation as far as possible and whenever possible, both through the use of mechanical systems and opening windows and doors;</li>
<li>take steps to encourage audiences to support the overall safety of the event, including discouraging activities which can create aerosol (such as shouting, chanting and singing along), seating individuals rather than allowing them to stand (to help maintain social distancing) and the other mitigations outlined in the government guidance; and</li>
<li>comply with any specific guidelines and policies of the relevant performance venue to the extent they exceed the requirements of the Policy and the Activity Plan.</li>

<p>When choosing any third party controlled venue to conduct activities a separate assessment shall be made as to whether such venue complies with its own government mandated requirements as to COVID-19 security and as to whether the SEDOS activity can be conducted at that venue in adherence with the Policy and any Activity Plan.&nbsp;</p>
