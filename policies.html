<h1 id="conflict-of-interest-policy">CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY</h1>
<h3 id="a-introduction">A: INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>This policy applies to trustees of the Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society (‘Sedos Trustees’) and sets out guidelines and procedures for identifying, monitoring and managing actual and potential conflicts of interest by Sedos Trustees.</p>
<p>In the most general sense, the relevant law says that a Sedos Trustee cannot:</p>
<ul>
<li>benefit from an arrangement or transaction entered into by Sedos, if before the arrangement or transaction was entered into, the Sedos Trustee did not disclose their interest to all of the other Sedos Trustees; and</li>
<li>accept a benefit from a third party conferred by reason of being a Sedos Trustee or by reason of doing (or not doing) anything in their role as a Sedos Trustee unless the acceptance of the benefit cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is an actual or potential conflict of interest for a Sedos Trustee, it needs to be declared and dealt with in accordance with this policy, the Sedos Constitution and the relevant law. In addition, if it is determined that a transaction gives rise to a conflict, then the transaction needs to be authorised by the Sedos Trustees before that transaction proceeds. It should be noted that this does not apply to a reimbursement by Sedos to a Sedos Trustee (or payment by a Sedos Trustee out of Sedos’ funds) of expenses properly incurred by the Sedos Trustee in the performance of any of Sedos’ functions.</p>
<p>In this policy, references to:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;conflicts&quot; or &quot;conflicts of interest&quot; include actual and/or potential conflicts of interest and/or duty;</li>
<li>persons who are &quot;connected&quot; with a charity trustee means:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>a child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, brother or sister of a charity trustee;</li>
<li>the spouse, unmarried partner or civil partner of a charity trustee or of any person falling within paragraph (i) above;</li>
<li>any person who is in a business partnership with a charity trustee or any person who is in a business partnership with any person falling within paragraph (i) or (ii) above; and</li>
<li>any company, business, trust or organisation in which a charity trustee (or any other person connected to them) has an interest as a beneficiary or through ownership, control or influence.</li>
<li>If in doubt about whether a person is connected, a Sedos Trustee should seek external advice from a solicitor or other person qualified to advise on the matter; and</li>
<li>&quot;benefit&quot; includes any payment or material benefit (including property, loans, goods and services), other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sedos Constitution (at Section 7) sets out some procedures in relation to conflicts of interest. This policy should be read in conjunction with the Sedos Constitution and relevant provisions in the Sedos Constitution take precedence over this policy. </p>
<h3 id="b-the-purpose-of-this-policy">B: THE PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY</h3>
<p>Sedos Trustees have a personal duty to act in the best interests of Sedos. This means that they must not place themselves in a position where they have, or may have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts with their duties as a Sedos Trustee and must not profit from their position as a Sedos Trustee.  The Charities Act 2011 and Charitable Incorporated Organisations (General) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/3012) also set out some specific duties and responsibilities in relation to conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Conflicts of interest can inhibit open discussions and may result in Sedos Trustees taking irrelevant considerations into account or making decisions that are not in Sedos’ best interests. They can also damage the reputation of Sedos if it appears that Sedos Trustees are influenced by personal interests or loyalties. All Sedos Trustees must therefore be alert to the possibility that they, or other Sedos Trustees, could be affected by a conflict of interests. </p>
<p>The procedures in this policy will enable Sedos Trustees to identify and manage conflicts of interest so that they can ensure that conflicts do not prevent them from making decisions in the best interest of Sedos. The policy will also help protect Sedos and the Sedos Trustees from any appearance of impropriety in cases where conflicts of interest arise.</p>
<h3 id="c-identifying-conflicts-of-interest">C: IDENTIFYING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</h3>
<p>A conflict of interest is any situation in which a Sedos Trustee's direct or indirect interests could, or could be seen to, prevent them from making a decision only in the best interests of Sedos.</p>
<p>Conflicts of interest may arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>where a Sedos Trustee (or a person connected to them) stands to obtain a benefit from Sedos; or</li>
<li>where a Sedos Trustee has a duty of loyalty to a third party that conflicts with their duty to Sedos.</li>
</ul>
<p>When considering if they have a conflict of interest, a Sedos Trustee must be aware of the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>a conflict of interest exists if there is a possibility that the Sedos Trustee's personal interest could influence their decision-making, even if the Sedos Trustee's decision-making is not in fact adversely affected by the conflict. A reasonable perception that a conflict of interest exists can be enough for a Sedos Trustee to be in breach of their duties; and</li>
<li>the interest that gives rise to a conflict may be direct or indirect and, in particular, a conflict may relate to the interests of someone who is connected to a Sedos Trustee as well as to their own personal interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is impossible to set out all situations which may result in a conflict, but they may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>selling, loaning or leasing Sedos’ assets to a Sedos Trustee (or a connected person);</li>
<li>acquiring, borrowing or leasing assets from a Sedos Trustee (or a connected person);</li>
<li>paying a Sedos Trustee for carrying out:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>their role as Sedos Trustee,</li>
<li>a separate paid post at Sedos (even if they have resigned as a Sedos Trustee); </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>paying a Sedos Trustee (or a connected person) for providing a service and/or goods to Sedos; </li>
<li>employing a person connected to a Sedos Trustee at Sedos;</li>
<li>making a grant to a Sedos Trustee (or a connected person);</li>
<li>when a Sedos Trustee (or a connected person) owes a legal obligation or duty towards another organisation or person (for example, an employer or another charity of which they are a charity trustee) that conflicts with the Sedos Trustee's duty to Sedos;</li>
<li>when a Sedos Trustee has a personal sense of loyalty to another organisation or person that conflicts with their loyalty to Sedos; and</li>
<li>when a Sedos Trustee has religious or political views that could interfere with their ability to make decisions in the interest of Sedos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-procedure-for-declaring-interests">D: PROCEDURE FOR DECLARING INTERESTS</h3>
<p>All Sedos Trustees have a personal responsibility to declare any interest that might reasonably be regarded as potentially giving rise to a conflict.</p>
<p>On appointment, all Sedos Trustees must complete a declaration of interests form:</p>
<ul>
<li>listing any personal interests, business interests or other direct or indirect interests that might potentially give rise to a conflict of interests;</li>
<li>listing any interests of connected persons that may potentially give rise to a conflict of interest;</li>
<li>declaring any gifts or hospitality received or offered to them in their capacity as charity trustee;</li>
<li>confirming that they are not aware of any conflict, other than those already disclosed, that exists between their role and their personal circumstances or other interests;</li>
<li>confirming that they will update the form annually, or sooner if any changes occur; and</li>
<li>confirming that they will declare any conflict that arises in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>The information provided by Sedos Trustees must be recorded in a register of Sedos Trustees' interests (the ‘Conflicts’ Register’). At least once in every 12-month period, all Sedos Trustees must review the information relating to them contained in the Conflicts’ Register and declare that the information is correct or make a further declaration if necessary. </p>
<p>It is for individual Sedos Trustees to decide which matters to declare but, if in doubt, they should make a declaration. </p>
<p>The information provided by Sedos Trustees will be processed in accordance with any prevailing Sedos Privacy Policy, and in any event with data protection principles as set out in the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018. Data will be processed only for the purposes set out in this policy and not for any other purpose.</p>
<h3 id="e-maintaining-the-conflicts-register">E: MAINTAINING THE CONFLICTS’ REGISTER </h3>
<p>The Secretary to the Sedos Trustees will be responsible for maintaining the Conflicts’ Register and will:</p>
<ul>
<li>record in the Conflicts’ Register all conflicts, interests, gifts and hospitality declared by Sedos Trustees; and</li>
<li>circulate amendments or additions to the Conflicts’ Register (if any) to the Sedos Trustees at the start of each Sedos Trustee meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Conflicts’ Register will be available for inspection by any Sedos Trustee.</p>
<h3 id="f-declaration-of-interests-by-prospective-sedos-trustees">F: DECLARATION OF INTERESTS BY PROSPECTIVE SEDOS TRUSTEES</h3>
<p>Before a prospective Sedos Trustee is appointed, they must be asked to declare any direct or indirect interests they have that might give rise to a conflict of interests.</p>
<p>If the Sedos Trustees consider it likely that the prospective Sedos Trustee will be subject to serious or frequent conflicts of interest, the Sedos Trustees should consider whether it is appropriate to proceed with the appointment.</p>
<h3 id="g-process-for-declaring-conflicts">G: PROCESS FOR DECLARING CONFLICTS</h3>
<p>The first item on the agenda of each Sedos Trustee meeting will be a standing item requiring all Sedos Trustees attending the meeting to declare any conflicts of interest relating to the matters to be discussed at the meeting.</p>
<p>If a Sedos Trustee considers that they have an actual or potential conflict, they must inform the Chair as soon as possible and always before any discussion of the relevant matter. The declaration must specify the nature and extent of any direct or indirect interest that gives rise to the conflict.</p>
<p>If a Sedos Trustee is aware that another Sedos Trustee has an actual or potential conflict that has not been declared, they must notify the Chair OR the other Sedos Trustees.</p>
<p>If the Chair is declaring a conflict, they must inform the Vice-Chair OR the other Sedos Trustees.</p>
<p>If a Sedos Trustee is uncertain whether or not they are conflicted, they should make a declaration to the Chair OR the other Sedos Trustees.  </p>
<p>The Secretary to the Sedos Trustees must note all conflicts declared in the minutes of the meeting in which they were declared or, if not declared in a meeting, in the minutes of the next Sedos Trustee meeting.</p>
<h3 id="h-procedure-for-assessing-conflicts-at-meetings">H: PROCEDURE FOR ASSESSING CONFLICTS AT MEETINGS</h3>
<p>At the start of each meeting of Sedos Trustees:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Chair must inform the other Sedos Trustees and the Secretary to Sedos of any conflict of interest that has been declared by a Sedos Trustee that relates to the business to be discussed at the meeting; and</li>
<li>the Secretary to Sedos will circulate any amendments or additions to the Conflicts’ Register made since the last meeting of Sedos Trustees.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way in which conflicts are dealt with will depend on the nature and extent of the conflict. The non-conflicted Sedos Trustees must therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>assess the nature and extent of the conflict;</li>
<li>assess the risk or threat to decision-making by the Sedos Trustees;</li>
<li>decide whether the conflict is serious (for example, the conflict is acute or extensive, will or may be seen to prevent the Sedos Trustees from making decisions in the best interests of Sedos, relates to a significant decision or risks significantly damaging Sedos' reputation); and</li>
<li>decide what steps to take to handle the conflict.</li>
</ul>
<p>When considering the conflict, the Sedos Trustees must take all relevant factors into account, make decisions only in the best interests of Sedos and always protect Sedos' reputation.</p>
<p>The conflicted Sedos Trustee must not take part in any discussion or decision about the conflict and how to handle it and will not be counted in the quorum for that part of the meeting.</p>
<p>The non-conflicted Sedos Trustees must consider whether it is necessary to seek legal advice on whether the conflict is serious and/or on how to manage the conflict declared.</p>
<h3 id="i-authorised-conflicts-of-interest">I: AUTHORISED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</h3>
<p>A Sedos Trustee's duty to avoid a conflict of interest does not apply if, and to the extent that, the conflict of interest is authorised by any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>an express provision in the Sedos Constitution;</li>
<li>a statutory provision, such as the powers in the Charities Act 2011 to:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>pay a charity trustee (or a connected person) for providing services to the charity (sections 185 to 188); or</li>
<li>take out and pay premiums for trustee indemnity insurance (section 189); or</li>
<li>the Charity Commission or the court.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case, the Sedos Trustee must always follow any conditions that apply to the authorisation.</p>
<h3 id="j-procedures-for-managing-conflicts">J: PROCEDURES FOR MANAGING CONFLICTS</h3>
<p>If the conflict arises owing to a financial transaction between Sedos and a Sedos Trustee (or a connected person), or because a Sedos Trustee (or a connected person) will or may obtain a benefit from Sedos:</p>
<ul>
<li>any potential or proposed benefit must be authorised in advance; and</li>
<li>the conflicted Sedos Trustee must:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>withdraw from all discussions and decisions in relation to the matter; and</li>
<li>not be counted in the quorum for that part of the meeting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the non-conflicted Sedos Trustees decide that a conflict is serious, they must consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>securing the conflicted Sedos Trustee's resignation and/or appointing a new Sedos Trustee who is not conflicted;</li>
<li>not pursuing the course of action that gives rise to the conflict or proceeding in a different way so that the conflict does not arise;</li>
<li>seeking independent, expert advice about how to handle the conflict; and</li>
<li>asking the Charity Commission for guidance.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a conflict is not serious, the non-conflicted Sedos Trustees must decide what procedures and level of participation by the conflicted Sedos Trustee are appropriate. A number of steps can be taken to deal with the conflict, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>requiring the conflicted Sedos Trustee to withdraw from the meeting for the relevant item and not to be counted in the quorum for that part of the meeting;</li>
<li>allowing the conflicted Sedos Trustee to remain in the meeting for the relevant item to take part in the discussion, but requiring them to withdraw from the meeting during decision-making and to have no right to vote on the matter; or </li>
<li>appointing a new, non-conflicted Sedos Trustee.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the non-conflicted Sedos Trustees decide that the conflict is low risk (in that it will not prevent the conflicted Sedos Trustee from making decisions in the best interests of Sedos), they may agree that the conflicted Sedos Trustee may continue to participate in discussions and the decision-making process.</p>
<p>The Chair must inform the conflicted Sedos Trustee of the non-conflicted Sedos Trustees' decision about how to manage the conflict.</p>
<p>The minutes of the relevant meeting must include a record of the nature and extent of the conflict, an outline of the discussion and the actions taken to manage the conflict.</p>
<p>Where a Sedos Trustee or a connected person receives a payment or benefit from Sedos, this must be reported in the annual accounts in accordance with the current Statement of Recommended Practice for accounting by charities (Charities SORP).</p>
<h3 id="k-advisers-and-conflicts">K: ADVISERS AND CONFLICTS</h3>
<p>Before appointing any advisers to Sedos, the Sedos Trustees must consider whether the adviser has, or may be seen to have, any actual or potential conflict with the interests of Sedos.</p>
<p>Although most advisers will be members of professional or regulatory bodies and will be required to comply with the relevant professional guidelines, some advisers will not be members of such bodies. The terms of appointment of those advisers may therefore need to be modified to include specific provisions relating to conflicts:  </p>
<ul>
<li>an obligation to inform the Sedos Trustees if any circumstances arise in which they are or may be conflicted; and </li>
<li>an obligation to address any conflicts that arise in the work they do for the Sedos Trustees.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="l-training">L: TRAINING</h3>
<p>All newly appointed Sedos Trustees must receive training on this policy and on identifying situations that may result in a conflict and ways in which conflicts can be managed in practice. In addition, charity trustees must be familiar with the principles contained in the Charity Commission's guidance on conflicts.</p>
<h3 id="m-monitoring-enforcing-and-reviewing-this-policy">M: MONITORING, ENFORCING AND REVIEWING THIS POLICY</h3>
<p>Any Sedos Trustee who becomes aware of a breach of this policy must report it to the Secretary to the Sedos Trustees or the Chair as soon as possible. This policy shall be enforced by the Sedos Trustees as a body. This policy shall be made available to members of Sedos via the Sedos website. This policy will be reviewed annually in line with industry best practice standards and all relevant legislation and regulations.</p>

<li>ensure that accidents and dangerous occurrences are reported and properly investigated;</li>
<li>ensure that an adequate supply of personal protective equipment is available when necessary;</li>
<li>identify where improvements such as further training or revision of current working practices may be appropriate to prevent recurrence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Competent Person(s):</p>
<ul>
<li>accept their appointment as a Competent Person and be familiar with this Policy;</li>
<li>shall be responsible for keeping a log of all material accidents and incidents that occur at a Sedos Premises or that are directly related to a Sedos activity occurring outside of a Sedos Premises (the “Incident Logbook”) which shall be kept in electronic format on the Sedos Google sharefile;</li>

<li>that regularly attend such activities. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Such persons do not need to be Competent Persons, however the Management Committee should have due regard to productions/activities with a heightened level of HSE risk, where appointing a Competent Person to oversee high risk activities may be appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="c-risk-assessment">C: RISK ASSESSMENT</h3>
<p>As at the date of this Policy, Sedos has identified the following areas where there may be health and safety risks to Sedos volunteers and where Sedos owes a duty of care to the Sedos volunteers to take sensible measures to tackle those risks so far as reasonably practical:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Maintenance of equipment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All specialist systems (lifts, fire and security alarms, emergency lighting) will be maintained by an external specialist who will undertake all inspections and tests at regular intervals as contracted.</li>

Directors, Producers, Stage Managers and Organisers shall thoroughly assess situations in which manual handling and lifting are necessary and where necessary, will be responsible for making sure that all relevant Sedos volunteers have received basic instruction on manual handling techniques. </li>
<li>Assessment will consider the tasks, the loads, the working environment and the volunteers involved and will endeavour to reduce the risk of injury so far as is reasonably practicable. Proper assistance and instruction will be present for any hazardous lifting operation.</li>
<li>Any Personal Protective Equipment that is requested in order to limit the risk of accident or injury during any manual handling task will be provided by Sedos. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Protective Equipment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All Sedos volunteers engaging in activities for Sedos or on Sedos Premises will be provided with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) on request or when risk assessment of a task has deemed PPE to be essential.</li>
<li>Any person or persons who are asked to use PPE to perform any task or tasks must comply and use all PPE provided for the duration of that task.  </li>
<li>All PPE owned by Sedos must be kept in a reasonable condition for use, so it can be used to full effect as protective equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Effects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Producer and/or Technical Supervisor on any given Sedos show will ensure that any special effects used in a show such as pyrotechnics and smoke are safe to handle, safely used under their guidelines (including storage) and cause no harm or side effects to public or Sedos volunteers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Power Tool and Work Equipment Use</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Management Committee shall ensure that all volunteers are fully informed of all working equipment and its use. All volunteers will be fully trained in respect of any particular work equipment before the use of such work equipment, including power tools. </li>
<li>Risk assessments will be carried out to assess the hazards presented by the work equipment and identify any precautions which are needed to ensure the health and safety of volunteers. </li>
<li>Volunteers must ensure that precautions required for the safe operation of work equipment are used in accordance with training or instructions received.</li>
<li>Volunteers shall ensure that work equipment shall be stored and handled in accordance with all relevant laws and best practice</li>
<li>Any accident involving work equipment must be logged in the Incident Logbook.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Working at Height</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sedos recognises that nominated and approved volunteers may be required to work at height using equipment provided by the Theatre or, on occasion, during performance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sedos is aware that one of the major causes of injury is falls from height. Therefore no volunteer may work at height unless:</p>
<ul>
<li>safety checks on access equipment (ladders, scaffolding etc.) are carried out regularly and prior to each use; and</li>
<li>use of working at height equipment is limited to those that are trained and competent in their use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p> If a performer is required to work at height as part of the performance then, in addition to the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Competent Person shall be engaged to discuss the particular work required to ensure such working at height is done safely as possible;</li>
<li>the performer shall be properly advised by a Competent Person, Stage Manager or other relevant competent person of the risks involved with working at height in the manner intended; and</li>
<li>all reasonable precautions should be taken to ensure the safety of the performer including giving the performer appropriate time to practice with appropriate PPE and other safety precautions and not requiring the performer to undertake any work at height that they are not comfortable with conducting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Safety checks on access equipment (ladders, scaffolding) must be carried out regularly. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Under no circumstances should any Sedos volunteer undertake any work at height whilst alone in a Sedos Premises.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>There is a legal hierarchy for selecting equipment for work at height, based on using the safest possible method of work that can reasonably and practicably be used in the circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not work at height – use auto focus or bounce focus lights, bring scenery items down to ground level for adjustment etc</li>
<li>Work from an existing place of work – use gantries, bridges or catwalks, a trampoline system or similar.</li>
<li>Work positioning – use fixed length lines to prevent falls, MEWPs</li>
<li>Fall mitigation – use airbags, nets, inertia reel harnesses (which require a rescue plan)</li>
<li>Systems of work – use ladders, Tallescopes, Zargees etc</li>
<li>Further information on working at height can be found in the ABTT <a href="https://www.abtt.org.uk/" target="_blank">Code of Practice for the selection and use of temporary access equipment for working at heights in theatres</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Special Groups at Risk</p>
<ul>
<li>Sedos takes seriously the protection of special groups which may be at risk. All volunteers shall comply with the separate Sedos Safeguarding Policy.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="investment-policy"><strong>INVESTMENT POLICY</strong></h1>
<h3 id="a-introduction-1">A: INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society (Sedos) is a charitable incorporated organisation (CIO), whose purpose is (i) to educate the public in the fields of dramatic and musical theatre and to further development of public appreciation of and taste in the said fields and (ii) to give the opportunity for persons interested in the fields of dramatic and musical theatre to participate whether on or off stage in theatrical productions of high quality. </p>
<p>Under article 4(5) of the Sedos constitution, Sedos has the power to “deposit or invest funds, employ a professional fund manager and arrange for the investments or other property of the CIO to be held in the name of a nominee, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as the trustees of a trust are permitted to do by the Trustee Act 2000”.</p>
<p>Sedos has an annual income from ticket sales, programme sales, membership subscriptions, and fees for classes and workshops of approximately £120,000 to £140,000. Annual expenditure is approximately £120,000 per annum, allowing for a small annual surplus of approximately£0-20,000 per annum. Any annual surplus of income over expenditure is applied to the Sedos reserve capital held in an account with Lloyds Bank.</p>
<p>In addition, Sedos has been the beneficiary of the transfer of reserve capital from its predecessor charity vehicle, registered charity 1099443 (‘Old Sedos’). The transfer of funds from Old Sedos occurred when Sedos decided to restructure itself as a CIO. The funds from Old Sedos were made up of corporate charitable donations and an individual legacy request Old Sedos transferred approximately £536,000 to Sedos and these funds have been held as Sedos reserves in a bank account with Lloyds Bank, for any unforeseen expenditure and to support Sedos strategic objective of securing long term rehearsal and performance spaces.</p>
<p>Sedos currently holds no reserves outside the funds held in the Lloyds Bank Account.</p>
<p>The Board of Sedos has determined that the sum of up to 70% of the Society’s liquid assets (i.e. cash plus investments)should be invested in Rathbones Active Income and Growth Fund. These funds should be invested to grow at least in line with inflation. They are being invested to achieve a return so that they can further Sedos charitable aims. The Board has determined that the investment with Rathbones Active Income and Growth Fund should be a financial investment and should achieve the best financial return within the level of risk considered to be acceptable. Should the investments with Rathbones come to total more than 70% of liquid assets (either through investment performance or a reduction in the society’s cash balances) then the portfolio should be rebalanced at least semi-annually.</p>
<p>The Board of Sedos have determined that a portion of reserves within the Lloyds Bank Account will be transferred to Charity Bank where such funds will be invested to directly further the aims of other charitable organisations, as well as achieving a financial return for Sedos. The balance of funds held in the Lloyds Bank Account will be used for the day to day running of Sedos to achieve its charitable purpose.</p>
<p>The Investment Committee review investment decisions at regular meetings. Responsibility for day- to day investment management will lie with an authorised professional investment manager regulated by the FCA. This will be on a discretionary basis.</p>
<h3 id="b-investment-objectives">B: INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES</h3>
<p>The Board of Sedos seeks to produce the best financial return within an acceptable, medium level of risk.</p>
<p>The investment objective for the long term investments is to generate a return in excess of inflation.</p>
<p>The investment objective for the short term is to preserve the capital value with a medium level of risk. Assets should be readily available to meet unanticipated cash flow requirements, as well as the anticipated capital expenditure to support Sedos strategic objective of securing long term rehearsal and performance spaces, when such spaces become available.</p>
<p>The Board of Sedos would like to achieve a targeted return of CPI +3% in order to grow assets above inflation.</p>
<h3 id="c-risk">C: RISK</h3>
<p>Attitude to Risk</p>
<ul>
<li>Sedos is reliant on legacies and on donations for its activities. Investment assets are held as reserves.</li>
<li>The key risk to the long term reserves is inflation and the assets should be invested to mitigate this risk over the long term. The Board of Sedos understand that this is likely to mean that investment will be concentrated in real assets and that the capital value will fluctuate. It is recognised that in order to achieve the desired growth of the assets, a medium level of risk will be necessary. The Board of Sedos is comfortable with this. The focus of investment should include consideration for lowering volatility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assets</p>
<ul>
<li>Sedos assets can be invested widely and should be diversified by asset class and by security. Asset classes could include cash, bonds, equities, property, hedge funds, structured products, private equity, commodities and any other asset that is deemed suitable for Sedos.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currency</p>
<ul>
<li>The base currency of the investment portfolio is Sterling.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-liquidity-requirements">D: LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS</h3>
<p>Income from the long term investments will be re-invested. If there is a shortfall in income outside the investments, the Board may decide to draw down some of the capital, but this is not expected to be a regular occurrence.</p>
<h3 id="e-time-horizon">E: TIME HORIZON</h3>
<p>Sedos expects to hold investments for a long term time horizon of 6 to 10 years.</p>
<h3 id="f-investment-policy">F: INVESTMENT POLICY</h3>
<p>Sedos has adopted an investment policy to ensure that its investments do not conflict with its aims.</p>
<p>As such, Sedos wishes to avoid investments in any companies with a poor environmental record (e.g., recent cautions or convictions for pollution) or in companies who have been sanctioned for human rights abuses.</p>
<h3 id="g-management-reporting-and-monitoring">G: MANAGEMENT, REPORTING AND MONITORING</h3>
<p>Sedos has appointed a professional investment management firm, Rathbones, to manage the assets on a discretionary basis, in line with this investment policy. The Board of Sedos has nominated a list of authorised signatories, two of which are required to sign instructions to Rathbones.</p>
<p>Rathbones will provide the following information on a quarterly basis: valuation of investments and transaction report. Rathbones will also provide an annual report.</p>
<p>The Board of Sedos has responsibility for agreeing strategy and monitoring the investment assets. The Investment Committee will review the information provided by Rathbones at their meetings. Rathbones will be required to present in person to the Investment Committee on an annual basis. The Investment Committee will report the value of the portfolio to the Board of Sedos at each Board meeting. </p>
<p>Performance of the investments will be measured against inflation +3% after fees over any rolling five year period.</p>
<h3 id="h-approval-and-review">H: APPROVAL AND REVIEW</h3>
<p>This Investment Policy Statement was prepared by the Board of Sedos to provide a framework for the management of its investments. It will be reviewed on an annual basis to ensure continuing appropriateness.</p>

<h1 id="photography-policy">PHOTOGRAPHY POLICY</h1>
<h3 id="a-introduction-3">A: INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>This policy aims to make photography at Sedos a more &quot;human&quot; experience, to increase comfort for the actors and to take their anxiety and desires into account, by increasing transparency and communication with those whose images we use. </p>
<p>This policy includes videos and still photographs, using the same principles.</p>
<p>Sedos acknowledges that actors might be self-conscious of their image, be worried about their image’s presentation to the public, or have issues with certain representations of their personal image. This policy attempts to ensure that actors have a good experience with Sedos’s use of their image, yet still retain the ability to correctly market a show through the use of images of the actors.</p>
<p>The following is Sedos’s photography policy. This policy should be put on the website, and all members of the production team should adhere to these policies.</p>
<h3 id="b-notifying-casts">B: NOTIFYING CASTS</h3>
<p>Audition forms must include a checkbox that reads as follows: </p>
<p>“Please initial/tick box:</p>
<p>[        ]  I acknowledge that Sedos and photographers assigned by Sedos, have the irrevocable and unrestricted right to use and publish photographs of me during auditions, rehearsal or performance of this production, for editorial, trade, advertising, and promotion of this show or the society, in any manner and medium; and to alter and composite the same. I hereby release the Photographer and Sedos and their legal representatives and assigns from all claims and liability relating to said photographs.</p>
<p>This should be accompanied on the form by a link to the photography policy, using this link: <a href="https://sedos.co.uk/policies#photography-policy" target="_blank">https://sedos.co.uk/policies#​photography-policy</a> </p>
<p>Audition forms must be retained. Because of this release, they are official documents. Scanning them and putting them online in a shared folder, or using an online form throughout, is ideal.</p>
<p>Actors have the right to speak to any member of the production team (including the committee liaison) at any time regarding any images of them or any process involved in their creation. Sedos has the right to control the marketing for the show, but we all want the actors to feel comfortable and raise concerns. </p>
<p>The production team must inform the actors how their image is being used. For most images, an introductory conversation is the only conversation that will inform them of how we’ll be using their photos. Only a simple conversation is needed for headshots, rehearsal shots, staged marketing shots, and dress rehearsal photos. For the most significant uses of actor images, such as if their faces are prominently displayed on the poster or other major advertising, the production team will give the actors the opportunity to be more directly involved.</p>
<p>We will be taking headshots, rehearsal shots and shots of the dress rehearsal. The actors should expect each of these, and we will communicate when those happen so they can prepare physically and mentally.</p>
<h3 id="c-photo-edits">C: PHOTO EDITS</h3>
<p>For the following types of edits (or similar), the photographers and/or production team does not need to inform the actors nor seek their approval:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filters, exposure or basic colour edits that change exposure, colour levels. </li>
<li>Changing of the environment, as long it is not controversial. This includes things like removing signage or marks on the wall, removing distracting items from the environment, editing lighting, etc. This might include edits such as cutting out their image and putting it into a different background (like a stage, a set, etc.).</li>
<li>Minor blemish removal (pimples, hairs, minor cuts and scrapes).</li>
<li>Minor effects on their personal image such as skin softening or localized lighting adjustments.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the following types of edits (or similar), the photographers and/or production team will inform the actors (before publication), but will not seek their approval:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stylistic edits (such as edge sharpening) that cast them in a character-appropriate light, which might be unflattering (for an example of this, please see the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/DKAvzZXM7iUWHHri7" target="_blank">Gormenghast photos</a>). Such techniques include but are not limited to: HDR, edge detection, and an unpleasant or unfavourable countenance (smile, frown, menace, growl, etc.)</li>
<li>Placing their image into new environments that are show-specific and not edgy (violent, sexual, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The photographers and/or production team will inform the actors and will seek their approval for the following types of edits before their publication. </p>
<ul>
<li>If their image will be used in a non-group setting (fewer than 3 people) in major marketing materials such as the show poster (but not show imagery).</li>
<li>If any image might be deemed sexual or violent in nature.</li>
<li>If we will make significant changes to their person such as changing their facial or body shape, or changing their body. This includes removing things like scars and tattoos and anything else that the actor may feel is part of their “identity”.</li>
<li>Placing their image into new environments that are show-specific and might be considered edgy (violent, sexual, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Actors should understand that informal photos may be taken by other cast members or production staff, and these may be used for marketing purposes. </p>
<p>Actors do not retain the right to approve photos used of them – except in the specific cases mentioned above – but if an actor flags that they have a problem with an image, such a conversation should be taken seriously and action taken to remove or modify the photo(s) if possible. </p>
<p>It is recommended that photographers and production teams take all skin colours into account for headshots, so the actors are best represented.</p>
<h3 id="d-photoshoots">D: PHOTOSHOOTS</h3>
<p>Before each photoshoot…</p>
<ul>
<li>The production team should notify the actors in advance so they can prepare themselves for the event, both physically and mentally. It may be difficult for actors if their photographs are taken immediately after a dance rehearsal; actors should be given the ability to look their best.</li>
<li>Actors should understand how these images are to be used. If it’s just simple headshots, rehearsal photos and dress rehearsal photos, then just a quick overview will do. However, if this is an explicit complicated photoshoot (such as done with Pippin, Government Inspector, or similar), then please ensure the cast is aware of the vision, purpose and their role in that process.</li>
<li>Photographers should be briefed on the editing policy and pointed to the online version.</li>
<li>Photographers should be introduced to the cast to help put the actors at ease; a simple group introduction is all that’s needed. This is especially important during 1-on-1 shoots like headshots, but also important for dress and rehearsal shots. </li>
<li>Photographers should minimize their edits to the “first type” above (where we do not ask for actors’ permission). For further edits, or if there are any questions, please consult with the production team.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="risk-management-policy">RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY</h1>
<h3 id="a-introduction-4">A: INTRODUCTION  </h3>
<p>The Sedos Trustees recognise that risk management is essential to Sedos’ governance and to Sedos’ continued and sustainable pursuit of its charitable objects, and is a mechanism to help Trustees fulfil their legal duties. Sedos’ approach to risk management is designed to ensure:- </p>
<ul>
<li>The identification, assessment and management of risk is linked to the achievement of the SEDOS's objectives;</li>
<li>All areas of risk are covered - for example, financial, governance, operational and reputational;</li>
<li>A risk exposure profile can be created that reflects the Sedos Trustees' views as to what levels of risk are acceptable;</li>
<li>The principal results of risk identification, evaluation and management are reviewed and considered by the Sedos Trustees on a regular basis; and</li>
<li>Risk management is ongoing and embedded in management and operational procedures.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the responsibility of all Trustees, individually and collectively, to identify and manage risk. </p>
<p>The Trustees will regularly review and assess the risks faced by Sedos in all areas of its work and plan for the management of those risks. </p>
<p>There are risks associated with all Sedos’ activities: they can arise through things that are not done, as well as through ongoing and new initiatives. Risk exposure for Sedos will vary depending on circumstance. For example Sedos may be willing to expose itself to higher risks as the size of Sedos’ reserves increases. Risk tolerance may also be a factor in what activities are undertaken to achieve objectives. The Trustees will therefore ensure that there is an appropriate balance taken between higher and lower risk activities. </p>
<p>These considerations will inform the Trustees in their decision as to the levels of risk they are willing to accept.</p>
<p>The Trustees must let the Sedos Management Committee and the Sedos volunteer community know the boundaries and limits set by their risk policies to make sure there is a clear understanding of the risks that can and cannot be accepted.</p>
<h3 id="b-identifying-sedos-risks">B: IDENTIFYING SEDOS RISKS</h3>
<p>As part of Sedos’ good governance, the Trustees will maintain a risk register. This register is a ‘living document’ and forms the baseline for further risk identification. </p>
<p>The  Trustees recognise that new risks will appear and other risks will become less or more severe or may disappear over time. Risk identification is therefore an ongoing process within Sedos. </p>
<p>When new risks are identified by a Trustee, a member of the Management Committee or a volunteer, these will be referred to the Secretary to the Board of Trustees who will, in consultation with the Chair of Trustees, update the risk register accordingly. The Trustees must review the risk register, and the risks identified in it, at least annually. Sub-Committees of the SEDOS Board may review aspects of risk in more detail from time to time, and will report to the Board of Trustees on any findings from such reviews.</p>
<p>In undertaking this, the Trustees and the Management Committee will consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sedos’s objectives, mission and business plan;</li>
<li>The nature and scale of Sedos’ productions and activities;</li>
<li>The outcomes that need to be achieved;</li>
<li>External factors that might affect Sedos such as legislation and regulation;</li>
<li>Sedos’ reputation with its major funders, supporters and volunteers;</li>
<li>Past mistakes and problems that Sedos has faced;</li>
<li>The governance and operating structure of Sedos;</li>
<li>Comparisons with other charities working in the same area or of similar size; and</li>
<li>Examples of risk management prepared by other charities or other organisations.</li>
</ul>
<p>In developing the Sedos risk register, the Trustees and the Management Committee will identify/update risks in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governance risk;</li>
<li>Operational risk; </li>
<li>Financial risk; and</li>
<li>External factors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-assessing-monitoring-and-evaluating-risk">C: ASSESSING, MONITORING AND EVALUATING RISK </h3>
<p>Identified risks need to be put into perspective in terms of the potential severity of their impact and likelihood of their occurrence. Assessing and categorising risks helps in prioritising and filtering them, and in establishing whether any further action is required. </p>
<p>When a new risk arises, the Trustees in consultation with the Management Committee will then assess the risks identified by based on how likely they are to occur and how severe their impact using the methodology set out at Appendix 1.</p>
<p>They will identify those risks that require further action and will propose appropriate actions to mitigate these risks. Mitigating actions will have clearly identified owners.</p>
<p>The risk register can be updated or amended between meetings of the Trustees where agreed by the Trustees and in accordance with any constitutional requirements on decision making. </p>
<p>Examples of possible actions to mitigate risks are set out in Appendix 2.</p>
<h3 id="d-sedos-risk-register">D: SEDOS RISK REGISTER</h3>
<p>The SEDOS Risk Register is set out at Appendix 3.</p>
<p>[insert APPENDIX 1-3]</p>
<p><em>Approved 30 March 2020</em></p>

<h1 id="safeguarding-policy">SAFEGUARDING POLICY</h1>
<h3 id="a-introduction-5">A: INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>This document sets out the policy and procedure for safeguarding and managing safeguarding incidents within The Stock Exchange Dramatic And Operatic Society (Sedos).  This policy applies to all members, volunteers and contractors connected to Sedos projects, whether formal or informal.  This policy will be reviewed annually in line with industry best practice standards.</p>
<p>Our policy is simple:</p>
<p>●  every member should feel safe;</p>
<p>●  every member should feel respected; and</p>
<p>●  every member should feel supported.</p>
<p>Where a member feels that this policy has been breached, they should report their concerns via the relevant process below.</p>
<p>All incidents will be reported in accordance with this policy in a timely manner and documentation held confidentially for the time period required by law.</p>
<p>Where an assessment is made that a membership may be revoked as a result of an incident this will be submitted to the Chair of the Board of Trustees for determination by the Board of Trustees in accordance with clause 9(4) of the Constitution of Sedos.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of each show’s Producer to make their cast and crew aware of the policy and reporting procedures.  Our policy will be displayed at any permanent rehearsal venue used by Sedos and shall be made available in a prominent place on the Sedos website.</p>
<h3 id="b-designated-officers">B: DESIGNATED OFFICERS</h3>
<p>Sedos shall ensure that at all times a Principal Safeguarding Officer (PSO) and Welfare Officer are appointed from among its members.</p>
<p>Appointments shall be proposed by the Management Committee and approved by the Board of Trustees. Appointments may be revoked by a resolution of the Board of Trustees. An officer may resign from their appointment in writing to the Chair of the Management Committee and Chair of the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>The Management Committee and Board of Trustees shall ensure that any member appointed to the role of PSO shall have adequate training and experience in performing such role including knowledge of all material statutory obligations of Sedos as it relates to safeguarding.</p>
<p>The Management Committee and Board of Trustees shall ensure that they have confidence that any member appointed to the role of Welfare Officer shall be capable of fulfilling such role.</p>
<p>The designated officers at the date of last revision of this policy (January 2021) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chair of Board of Trustees: Dawn Harrison-Wallace</li>
<li>PSO: Robert J. Stanex</li>
<li>Welfare Officer: Dr Kimberly Barker</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-safeguarding-children">C: SAFEGUARDING CHILDREN</h3>
<p>Sedos believes that all children should be safe from harm and we understand our duty of care to safeguard their welfare.  While our membership is only open to those over the age of 16, certain projects may require children to preserve the authenticity of a story.</p>
<p>Where a child (under 18) is required for a project, an assessment will be made by the Principal Safeguarding Officer (PSO) and a set of recommendations offered to the Producer prior to the audition notice being released.  Requirements for training, vetting, licensing and chaperoning will also be outlined at this time and must be adhered to.</p>
<p>Where an allegation has been made regarding a child or a child makes a disclosure, this will be investigated following best practice standards.  Where additional consultancy and support is needed this will be sought from NSPCC as industry experts.</p>
<h3 id="d-safeguarding-adults-at-risk">D: SAFEGUARDING ADULTS AT RISK</h3>
<p>The nature of our work means that it is highly unlikely we would have a direct service user who would be categorised as an Adult at Risk.  Where a member does meet this threshold, an assessment will be made by the PSO and a set of recommendations offered to the Producer of each show the member is involved with.</p>
<p>Where an allegation has been made regarding an Adult at Risk, this will be investigated following best practice standards.  Where additional consultancy and support is needed this will be sought from Ann Craft Trust as industry experts.</p>
<h3 id="e-safeguarding-against-sexual-harassment">E: SAFEGUARDING AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT</h3>
<p>As a society we often produce works which explore sensitive themes.  We recognise our responsibility in both addressing these issues appropriately and ensuring our members feel safe during the process.  We promote a culture of open dialogue and mutual consent.</p>
<p>Where an allegation has been made regarding Sexual Harassment the Welfare Officer will investigate following best practice standards and facilitate an appropriate intervention.</p>
<h3 id="f-safeguarding-against-bullying-behaviour">F: SAFEGUARDING AGAINST BULLYING BEHAVIOUR</h3>
<p>No member should be made to feel belittled or victimised by another member.  Those in positions of power including Directors, Producers and members of the Management Committee and Board of Trustees must be mindful of their added responsibility to create a positive environment and culture.</p>
<p>Where an allegation has been made regarding Bullying the Welfare Officer will facilitate an appropriate mediation with all parties.</p>
<h3 id="g-historic-cases">G: HISTORIC CASES</h3>
<p>Where an historic incident has been disclosed or uncovered this will be investigated by the relevant Officer in line with current legislation and guidance.</p>
<h3 id="h-reporting-an-incident">H: REPORTING AN INCIDENT</h3>
<p>Where an allegation is made concerning a child, this must be reported immediately to the PSO via safeguarding&#64;sedos.co.uk.</p>
<p>Where an allegation is made concerning an Adult at Risk, this must be reported immediately to the PSO via safeguarding&#64;sedos.co.uk.</p>
<p>Where an allegation is made concerning Sexual Harassment and-or Bullying within the context of a specific production, this must be reported to the relevant Committee Liaison in the first instance. Members will be informed of how to contact this person at the start of each project. The Committee Liaison will then report to the Welfare Officer as required. This shall not prevent any member from reporting directly to the attention of the Welfare Officer should they believe that it is necessary via [●]&#64;sedos.co.uk.</p>
<p>Alternatively, or where an allegation is made outside of a production, this must be reported to the Welfare Officer via [●]&#64;sedos.co.uk.</p>
<p>Allegations of incidents which occurred more than six months ago, should be reported directly to the Chair of the Board of Trustees via chair&#64;sedos.co.uk.</p>
<p>If an allegation is made regarding the PSO or Welfare Officer, it should be reported directly to the Chair of the Board of Trustees via chair&#64;sedos.co.uk.</p>
