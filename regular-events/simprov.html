        <p><strong>Simprov (Sedos-Improv…. see what we did there?) is a fortnightly drop-in session on Friday evenings that let's members and non-members explore their spontaneous side!</strong></p>
<p>Perfect for the complete beginner as well as the hardened improv veteran, sessions will explore the fundamental principles of improv such as making bold choices, character development and finding your ‘game’.</p>
<p>Improv is a great way to build confidence and develop performance skills in a very fun and safe environment.</p>
<h4 id="join-the-facebook-group-for-the-latest-information"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/176792046058352">JOIN THE FACEBOOK GROUP FOR THE LATEST INFORMATION</a></h4>
<p>The spring season of Simprov sessions are listed below</p>
<h3 id="march-saying-yes-and-finding-your-groove-on-stage">9 March | Saying yes and Finding Your Groove on Stage</h3>
<h4 id="james-alexander-stone-emma-leaver">James Alexander Stone &amp; Emma Leaver</h4>
<p>Saying 'yes' is the key to improv (and life!)! In the first of our sessions we'll cover the many ways you can say yes, how to be a supportive scene partner, and we'll use short form games to ease you in to imaginative scene work.</p>
<p>James played Ferdinand in the Sedos Immersive experience Such Stuff As Dreams Are Made On in 2016. He has been involved in improve both in and out of Sedos for the last 2 years.</p>
<p>Emma has been involved with Sedos for almost six years, mainly as a stage manager and director. She most recently directed The Drowsy Chaperone last year and has been in the last two Simprov shows.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="march-character-status">23 March | Character &amp; Status</h3>
<h4 id="rachael-castell-lloyd-smith">Rachael Castell &amp; Lloyd Smith</h4>
<p>We’ll be looking at ways into character including physicality, voice, emotion and real life references, as well as how to amplify your character in relation to your scene partner’s choice. We’ll also be playing lots of games about the difference between being a high-status character and being in charge of the scene.</p>
<p>Rachael thinks that improv is a life skill - which is how she justifies being ridiculous pretty much all of the time. She is especially ridiculous when empowered by her excellent Simprov colleagues, so is grateful to be a part of this group.</p>
<p>Lloyd is an active member with Sedos, having performed in the recent productions of Frankenstein and A Doll’s House. This is Lloyd’s first season with Simprov, and he’s very excited to try silly things with such a talented bunch!</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="april-finding-truth-in-improv">6 April | Finding Truth in Improv</h3>
<h4 id="alex-magliaro-and-jess-rogers">Alex Magliaro and Jess Rogers</h4>
<p>Improv doesn’t always have to be funny and the best scenes (which are often the funniest) stem from truth. This session will focus on finding what our natural strengths are, building on those and getting comfortable with ourselves and each other. We will work on being able to find the crux of a scene quickly and aim towards finding the truth in the absurd!</p>
<p>Alex has been an actor with Sedos for 5 years (Guys and Dolls, Enron, Heaven Can Wait, Noises Off, Priscilla Queen of the Desert). He co-found Simprov after realising there was scope for Sedos to use improv as an acting tool for the membership. He first studied Improv at UCB in NY before reviving his training at RADA in London. Simprov isn’t life, but his life is definitely improv’d!</p>
<p>Jess has been a member of Sedos for 3 years (Noises Off, Frenemies, Frankenstein), as well as performing with KDC (Den of Thieves, What Keeps Me Awake, The Red Envelope Project) . She joined Simprov last February absolutely loves it, she can't wait to explore more about improv through the company.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="april-games-vs-game">20 April | Games vs Game</h3>
<h4 id="chris-warner-sam-pearce">Chris Warner &amp; Sam Pearce</h4>
<p>Join Chris and Sam to explore the difference between Games, which are short, rules-based scenes (think: Who's line is it anyway?) and Game - the art of establishing a pattern of interactions, and then heightening them. Finding quickly in the moment, what is this scene really about? Game can be a bit of a mystery, but it's up to the players to ‘find it'. Will we? Come and find out!</p>
<p>Chris has done 10 shows with Sedos; mainly they are musicals where he tries to sing top As. Last year, Chris co-founded Simprov with Alex as a great way to explore an art form that was as equally scary as it was exciting and intriguing, and in that time he's learn't a lot about trusting his instincts and saying yes.</p>
<p>Sam’s time in Sedos has been filled with fun and silliness. His time in Simprov even more so. He got in at the ground floor, and now ‘offers’, ‘blocks’, and finds out ‘what this scene is really about’ on stage and in life.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="may-story-telling">4 May | Story Telling</h3>
<h4 id="jonny-scott-laura-capaldi">Jonny Scott &amp; Laura Capaldi</h4>
<p>We all tell stories on a daily basis (Laura does it for a job!). Good stories don't need to be long and complicated. Hemingway wrote a heartbreaker in six words, &quot;For sale: baby shoes, never worn.” This session will go through the basics of what good stories involve, how to tell a good tale and most importantly, how to end it!</p>
<p>Laura has been involved with Sedos since 2006 after a lifelong love affair with performing. In her real life she works as a television producer where making things up on the spot is always received positively, hence an equal love affair with improv has arisen.</p>
<p>Jonny debuted for Sedos in 2017, slinking his way into the world-renowned improv troupe, Simprov. With a chronic phobia for learning lines, improv has always been a natural home for Jonny, who spends the rest of his time as a strategy consultant, whatever that means.</p>
