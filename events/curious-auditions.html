<p><strong>ABOUT THE SHOW</strong></p>
<p>The neighbour’s dog shows up dead in her front garden. Fifteen-year-old Christopher Boone is determined to find out what happened through logical detective-work. But Christopher’s investigation uncovers more than he bargains for and leads him onto a journey outside his carefully ordered world.</p>
<p>Curious Incident takes us inside Christopher’s unique and wonderful mind. He discovers not only who killed the dog but also that his mother, who he believed dead, is actually alive. This spurs Christopher on to take a terrifying solo journey to London to try and find her.</p>
<p>This production will be movement-driven and character-centred, with a stripped-back, abstract set with use of custom-made projections, designed to draw the audience directly into Christopher’s mind. Most cast members will remain on stage for much of the performance, contributing to a continuous visual and atmospheric world. The play is framed as an adaptation of a book written by Christopher himself. As such, it does not follow a linear narrative: it shifts in time, and the storytelling reflects the perspective of its protagonist and how he processes the world. Movement, sound, and physical theatre will be central tools in expressing the emotions and sensory experiences that Christopher struggles to articulate.</p>
<p>For this production, we will be separating the “Voices” from the rest of the Multi-Role Ensemble. The six Voices are envisioned as a kind of Greek Chorus, embodying different facets of Christopher’s mind through physical movement, including lifts and ensemble movement. Sound will play a major role in shaping the atmosphere and supporting the storytelling. This includes original compositions created especially for the production by our composer, Ollie Jones, which will interweave with the movement to reflect the workings of Christopher’s mind. You can get a taster of Ollie’s music in the movement routine we’re using for auditions.</p>

<p><strong>CASTING | DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Sedos is committed to diversity and inclusion. Our commitment is to build and sustain a membership that is reflective of the diverse communities within London. We actively encourage all performers to audition for the roles which they feel best suit their skills.</p>
<p>All roles in <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em> are open to actors of all ethnicities.</p>
<p>Across the entire cast there are opportunities for actors of all ages and genders to be cast.</p>
<p>There are some roles with specific requirements as to playing age – this is specified in the role breakdown in the audition notice.</p>
<p>Some roles require particular gender presentation, again specified in the role breakdown below – anyone can audition for these roles, provided they are comfortable portraying that gender.</p>

<p>We are specifically seeking an actor for Christopher who identifies as neurodivergent. This is both an artistic and an ethical commitment: the production aims to represent Christopher’s internal world with authenticity, sensitivity, and insight, and we recognise that neurodivergent performers bring invaluable understanding to this portrayal. Auditionees are not required to specify a diagnosis, and do not need to have one either, but we ask performers only to audition if they feel the description resonates with them and we will not ask any questions in the audition room. We welcome neurodivergent people of any gender to audition for Christopher (as with any role) but you must be comfortable to portray the character as male.</p>
<p>While only the role of Christopher specifically requires a neurodivergent identifying actor, we strongly encourage neurodivergent performers to audition for any role in this production that resonates with them.</p>
<p>We are committed to respecting each individual’s preferred language when describing their identity or lived experience. In the audition form, you’ll have the option to share the terminology you use (e.g. “neurodivergent performer”, “identifies as neurodivergent”, “autistic performer”, “performer with autism” etc). We encourage you to use whatever language feels most authentic to you.</p>
<p>We encourage performers with disabilities to audition and are happy to discuss the requirements for different roles – some roles require lifting/being lifted, or lifting stage blocks, while others have no particular physical requirements.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/king-square" target="_blank">King Square Community Centre</a>, where most rehearsals will be held, has level access and an accessible toilet. Information about access to the Bridewell Theatre is <a href="https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell" target="_blank">available here</a>. The dressing room toilets at the Bridewell are up a short flight of stairs; we’d be happy to make adjustments so a cast member could use the accessible front of house toilet.</p>
<p>We are committed to creating an environment where everyone can thrive. If you require support or reasonable adjustments at any stage, from the audition application and auditions through to rehearsals and the production period, we are very happy to discuss these with you.</p>
<p>Our team is supported by accessibility consultant Ema‑Mae West (BSc Intellectual Disability Nursing, MSc Autism), a Neurodiversity Specialist with Mental Health First Aid and ASIST prevention training. With her guidance, we aim to ensure that our processes are inclusive, flexible, and responsive to individual needs.</p>
<p>If you’d like to talk about adjustments or support, please feel free to reach out at any point in the process (<a href="mailto:curious@sedos.co.uk" target="_blank">curious&#64;sedos.co.uk</a>).</p>
