<p><strong>Are auditions open to everyone?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! We welcome people of all levels, backgrounds, ages and experience. You do not have to be a Sedos member to audition for your shows.</p>
<p><strong>How do I find out about auditions?</strong></p>
<p>Check out the latest <a href="https://sedos.co.uk/get-involved" target="_blank">London auditions</a> online.</p>
<p>You can also sign up for our weekly newsletter so that you will receive all the latest news from Sedos, including about auditions. <a href="https://mailchi.mp/sedos.co.uk/newsletter-sign-up" target="_blank">Sign up here!</a></p>

<p><strong>How much does it cost to audition for a Sedos show?</strong></p>
<p>It is free for members and non-members to audition for Sedos shows.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to be a Sedos member to be involved in a show?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, all performers and core production team members (directors, musical directors, choreographers and producers) must be members of Sedos.</p>
<p><strong>How much does it cost to be a member of Sedos and to be in a show?</strong></p>
<p>Membership fees are £30 a year if paid by direct debit, £35 otherwise. If you are involved in a show you must be a member of Sedos for the entire rehearsal period and performance dates.</p>
<p>See below for benefits of membership.</p>
<p>All cast members also pay a participation fee of £30 for a play or £40 for a musical.</p>
<p>We would always be open to a discussion with anyone who found our membership or participation fees a barrier to taking part. </p>
<p><strong>What ability / experience is needed?</strong></p>
<p>This depends on the role. For the chorus / ensemble of a musical, you must be able to sing in tune and move well, as a minimum. There is high competition for most roles, and the best performer in the role at the audition is picked (regardless of Sedos membership). Just to stress this once more – the best auditionee for each part will be cast. You don’t have to ‘do your time’ in order to be cast in a Sedos show. We believe in quality.</p>
<p><strong>What will be in the audition?</strong></p>
<p>This will depend entirely on the show and the production team and will be detailed in the audition notice, as well as casting information and any specific requirements for the roles on offer. But it will probably be along these lines:</p>
<p>MUSICALS: You will be sent material to prepare in advance for both dialogue and singing, or you may be asked to prepare a song of your own choice in the style of the musical. There may also be a dance section where you learn a routine. Recalls may take a workshop format interacting with other potential cast members or may be done individually.</p>
<p>PLAYS: You will be sent dialogue to prepare in advance for the part(s) you are interested in. Recalls may take a workshop format interacting with other potential cast members or may be done individually.</p>
<p><strong>Can I meet the team before the auditions?</strong></p>
<p>There is also usually a pre-audition workshop so you can meet the team and find out more about the show and the auditions.</p>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of being a Sedos members</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced ticket prices on all Sedos shows</li>
<li>Reduced rate for <a href="https://sedos.co.uk/regular-events/sedance" target="_blank">Sedance</a></li>
<li>Members’ events</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, members have the right to stand for election to the trustees and management committee and to vote at General Meetings.</p>
<p>These benefits apply to the named member only. For the avoidance of doubt they are non-transferable, therefore, a member participating in a production may not use their discount to purchase tickets for friends or family.</p>
<p><strong>Can I get involved backstage?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! We are always keen to hear from anyone who is interested in getting involved on the production side. From props and set, sound and lighting designers and operators, costumes and makeup to stage managers and those backstage, our shows can only thrive with those willing to volunteer for these roles. All the benefits of being involved without having to learn your lines!</p>

<p><strong>How long is the rehearsal period?</strong></p>
<p>We prefer a short but intensive rehearsal period of about 8-12 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>When are rehearsals held?</strong></p>
<p>Weekday rehearsals (generally two per week, but not everyone is called to all rehearsals) are usually 6.30/7-9.30/10pm. Weekend rehearsals are generally held on a Saturday or Sunday from 10/11am-4/5pm. The whole cast may not be called to all rehearsals or to the whole rehearsal. Rehearsals are scheduled as far as possible around people’s availability, but we ask you please to be honest about your availability when auditioning to help us set schedules.</p>
<p><strong>Where are rehearsals held?</strong></p>
<p>We try to find free/cheap rehearsal space within easy reach of central London. Most of our auditions and rehearsals are currently at Theatre Deli Leadenhall Studios, 107 Leadenhall Street, London EC3A 4AF.</p>
<p><strong>Where do performances take place?</strong></p>
<p>We are the resident theatre company at the <a href="https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell" target="_blank">Bridewell Theatre</a>, just off Fleet Street in London, and we generally perform there for 10 weeks a year.</p>
<p>We also perform at other venues from time to time, including at the Edinburgh Fringe and the Minack Theatre.</p>
<p><strong>How long is the performance period?</strong></p>
<p>Either a one- or two-week production period is usual. Plays are generally one-week (though we have also done two-week plays), while we stage both two-week and one-week musicals.</p>
<p><strong>Who is in the audience?</strong></p>
<p>All the friends, family and colleagues that you have sold tickets to! Yes, we do rely on a level of ticket sales from the cast to cover our expenses. However, there are also long-term enthusiastic supporters of Sedos and past performers that come regularly to our shows, there is some interest from talent-spotting agents, and there are even a few general members of the public that have seen our publicity, picked up a flyer, or were just passing by (we know about them because they ask to join our mailing list afterwards).</p>
<p><strong>Are the cast required to help with the get-in and get-out?</strong></p>
<p>All cast, production teams and crew are required to help with the get-out. The cast are sometimes asked to help with the get-in, but not always. Production teams and crew are required to help with the get-in.</p>
<p>If you want to find out more about Sedos, please email membership&#64;sedos.co.uk for more details, and our membership secretary will be happy to get back to you.</p>
<p><strong>Is Sedos committed to diversity?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! Sedos is a founder member of <a href="https://www.londondramasocieties.co.uk/" target="_blank">London Drama Societies</a>, which commits each member society to the following statement:</p>
<p>“Collectively, we commit to take constant steps to be more inclusive and attract members and audiences reflecting London’s diversity.</p>
<p>“We will identify and remove barriers to create a safe and inclusive environment. We want everyone to feel empowered to participate, on stage or off. We want stories to be told authentically.”</p>
