                    <h2 id="how-we-operate">How we operate</h2>
<p>Sedos is a volunteer run-charity. The members of the society elect trustees who have overall responsibility for the charity and our long-term health. The trustees delegate the day to day management of the organisation to a management committee, whose members are also elected by the charity’s members. In addition, we have marketing, production and membership groups.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Historically, Sedos was run by “the committee” who acted as both the management group and the Society’s Trustees. At our AGM on 19 May 2017, it was agreed by the members to move to a new structure separating the day-to-day running of the society from the governance and long-term responsibilities. As such, the committee was renamed the &quot;trustees” and a new body, knowns as the management committee was set up to run the society on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>At the AGM, it was also agreed by the members that we would re-designate ourselves as a Charitable Incorporated Organisation. The “new” Sedos was incorporated on 21 July 2017 with charity number 1173896. The Charity is governed by its new constitution.</p>
<p>Click here to read the constitution.</p>
<p>We are currently running both Charities concurrently. With effect from 1 January 2018, the assets of the “old” Sedos will be transferred to the “new” Sedos and the “old” Sedos will be wound down.</p>
<p>Sedos’ charitable objects remain unchanged:</p>
<p>(i)              To educate the public in the fields of dramatic and musical theatre and to further the development of public appreciation of and taste in said fields; and</p>
<p>(ii)             To give an opportunity for persons interested in the fields of dramatic and musical theatre to participate whether on or off-stage in theatrical productions of high quality.</p>
<h2 id="management-committee">Management committee</h2>
<p>The management committee is responsible for the day to day management of Sedos. This includes responsibility for artistic policy and choosing the season, supporting production teams, maintaining artistic and production standards, keeping our members engaged with the society, budgeting and financial management.</p>
<p>The management committee is set up by the trustees to run the society and the members of the management committee are voted on by the society’s membership.</p>
