<blockquote class='blockquote text-center'>“As a long-time fan of Sedos, I was excited to be able to attend the first night of their first full dance production… Rest assured, my expectations were exceeded on both counts as the evening unfolded into a masterclass of dramatic contemporary dance which fully captured the themes of seduction and revenge of the original play. Each Sedos season showcases a range of plays and musicals, from popular, well-loved classics to lesser-known and newer works which can challenge both cast and audience. Their weekly Sedance class obviously attracts enthusiastic and highly competent dancers, and the decision to use this to add a new artform to their repertoire was brilliant and will hopefully herald more in the future. I can only add that they have set the bar very high with this one… It was a fantastic experience to be in the performance space with the dancers, feeling their every breath, absorbing their energy and watching the skill of their performance.
