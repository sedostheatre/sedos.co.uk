              <h1>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead Auditions<br />
                <span class="tiny">By Tom Stoppard</span></h1>
              <h3><br />
              Show Dates:</h3>
              <p> The Bridewell Theatre, 15th-19th July 2008</p>
              <h3>Audition Dates:</h3>
              <p> Saturday 26th April<br />
                Sunday 27th April (call-backs TBC)</p>
              <h3>Synopsis of Play:</h3>
              <p>A red hot slice of existential uncertainty, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (or Guildenstern and Rosencrantz, depending on your perspective) live the very essence of &ldquo;what&rsquo;s my motivation&rdquo; as they stumble through a series of events beyond their control or understanding. Flying the flag of &ldquo;what am I doing here&rdquo; for supporting characters everywhere, the pair face kings and queens, murder and murderers, clowns, boats, pirates, a manic depressive prince and&hellip; actors&hellip; </p>
              <h3>Directors Note:</h3>
              <p>This is a production that will NOT simply be a &ldquo;this is what&rsquo;s on the page&rdquo; presentation. The play is one I have been aching to put on for around 10 years, and over the time has evolved a real stylistic look. </p>
              <p>The set will be definite, but minimalist. The costumes will change as the action does. Despite the strong presence of the two main characters, as much devotion will be put to a troupe of 6-10 performers who will make up a wandering theatre company. There&rsquo;s a role of the Player to take account of, a sinister luvvie/pimp, and the silently distracting mad prince Hamlet himself.</p>
              <p>In addition to this there will be a live original soundtrack, which will initially be something worked on separately, but will eventually be synched to the play itself. If you have an interest in the musical aspect please contact me. </p>
              <p>The script has been trimmed, but will retain its original 3 act structure.</p>
              <h3>Workshop:</h3>
              <p>There will be a pre audition workshop on the 22nd of April (venue and further details TBC) where you can get the opportunity to hear more about the show, ask questions, and get an idea of what will be asked of you at the auditions. This is not compulsory if you want to audition, and is not part of the auditioning process! Don&rsquo;t worry! An e-mail will be sent out closer to the time with registration details.</p>
              <h3>Auditions:</h3>
              <p>These auditions will take place jointly with Don Carlos, at the same place; so don&rsquo;t worry about missing out on one by attending the other!</p>
              <p>More details will be sent out to all those who register. There will sections of script available closer to the time. The audition will consist of script readings and team workshops, so wear comfy clothes.</p>
              <p>There is a &pound;5 audition fee if you are not already a member. To register for these auditions please email the producer, It would be useful to state if you are only going for a specific character, or are open to all opportunities.</p>
              <h3>Music:</h3>
              <p>As stated above, there is a live music element with an original soundtrack. If you can play an instrument and would be keen to collaborate on themes that will be integrated into the show, please get in touch.</p>
              <h3>Rehearsals</h3>
              <p>Rehearsals will take place on Tuesday, Thursday (6.30-9.30ish) and Sunday (11-4ish). Not everyone will be called to all rehearsals, but rehearsals will start immediately.</p>
              <p>There is a &pound;20 participation fee plus all cast members will be expected to join SEDOS. Current membership is &pound;30 for the year. If you were not a member when auditioning your &pound;5 audition fee will be refunded when you join. </p>
              <h3>Characters:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern</strong> &ndash; A fantastic opportunity for a witty, fun double act. I will be looking for a pairing that have great chemistry and really support and feed off each other. <br />
                <strong>Open to both male and female auditionees</strong><br />
                <br />
                </li>
                <li><strong>The Player &ndash;</strong>
                  An older character. Part Luvvie, Part Pimp&hellip; He knows more than he&rsquo;s willing to let on about&hellip; sinister to boot&hellip; <br />
                  <strong>Open to both male and female auditionees</strong><br />
                  <br />
                </li>
                <li><strong>Hamlet &ndash;</strong> A character in itself in this production. Very present. A silent background distraction<br />
                  <strong>Male</strong><br />
                  <br />
                </li>
                <li>	<strong>The Tragedians</strong> &ndash; (I say &ldquo;tragEEdians&rdquo;, but I think it&rsquo;s meant to be &ldquo;tragedEEans&rdquo;) A group, or troupe of 6-10 performers to fill the stage as the Player&rsquo;s Company, Characters from Shakespeare&hellip; and Pirates! I do NOT regard these as &ldquo;bit parts&rdquo;. They will involve lots of physical story telling and a fight scene. Ideally the troupe SHOULD have members who can assume the roles of:<br />
                  <strong>Polonius</strong> &ndash; Old retainer of the Royal Family in Hamlet<br />
                  <strong>Claudius</strong> &ndash; Hamlet&rsquo;s uncle and King of Denmark<br />
                  <strong>Gertrude</strong> &ndash; Hamlet&rsquo;s mother and Queen of Denmark<br />
                  <strong>Ophelia</strong> &ndash; Hamlet&rsquo;s rejected girl&hellip;<br />
                  <strong>Open to both male and female auditionees</strong><br />
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Please come along and be very, very good and amaze me&hellip;</strong><br />
