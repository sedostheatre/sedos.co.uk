## Remember Sedos in your will

### A lasting act of support

Gifts in wills help us safeguard Sedos’s future and allow us to keep staging great shows in the years ahead. A bequest of any size is hugely valuable to us.

Sedos has been giving enjoyment to actors, those backstage and audiences for over 100 years. We want to be able to continue producing quality amateur theatre in London, at an affordable price, for generations to come. 

If you would like to share your passion for theatre beyond your lifetime, you might want to consider leaving a gift to the society in your will, once you have taken care of your loved ones.

Sedos is a registered charity, so there may be tax advantages to leaving money to the society – we advise you to seek professional advice on this.

### Remembering Jeremy Lewis

Jeremy Lewis had a long association with Sedos and served as a committee member and chairman of the society, as well as being the honorary president of Sedos for the last few years of his life.

Jeremy died in 2011 and in his will, he left a generous bequest to Sedos. To honour Jeremy’s wishes, the money is to be used for something special, which we would not otherwise be able to afford, not for standard or administrative costs. 

Three grants have been made from the Jeremy Lewis Fund. The first was to our 2017 production of Priscilla Queen of the Desert – the spectacular costumes were possible thanks to the fund. The second was for the set of Titanic in 2023, including rearranging the Bridewell seats to allow for a central entrance under the audience.

Most recently, the Sedos Trustees have awarded a Jeremy Lewis grant for our upcoming production of Company (7-16 May 2026). The grant will allow the team to realise their vision of turning the Bridewell into Bobby’s apartment, with the audience right inside the action. 

The Jeremy Lewis Fund is a brilliant example of how someone with a link to Sedos was able to continue their association with the society beyond their lifetime. Jeremy’s legacy allows Sedos to create imaginative theatre which pushes the boundaries beyond what amateur companies can typically achieve.
