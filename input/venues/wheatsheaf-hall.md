## Wheatsheaf Hall

Sedos uses Wheatsheaf Hall as a rehearsal and social venue. In the summer of 2024, we also brought this space to life as a performance venue when *[Sunday in the Park with George](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2024-sunday-in-the-park-with-george)* was presented there.

Wheatsheaf Hall has been a community venue since 1988 when members of the local community leased the building from the Council. It was awarded Grade II listed status in 1975 and is run by volunteers.

**Getting to Wheatsheaf Hall**

The closest tube station to Wheatsheaf is Nine Elms. The venue is also within walking distance of Vauxhall, Stockwell, Oval and Kennington tube stations. Vauxhall is also served by overground trains.

Buses 2 and 88 stop the closest to the venue. A number of other buses also travel along the A3036 and stop near Nine Elms station, just a few minutes walk away.

You cannot park right outside Wheatsheaf Hall – Wheatsheaf Lane is narrow and short, with no turning spaces at the end. If you drive in to drop people off, you will have to back out onto the main road.

**Cashless**

Please note, Sedos is now a cashless operation so all bar sales at our socials at Wheatsheaf are made by card payments.

**Accessibility**

Access to the hall and bar is over a threshold stone with a riser height ranging from 110-150mm from right to left.  

There is a gender neutral accessible toilet and ladies’ toilets on the main ground floor. The men’s toilets and urinals are down three steps. 

There are 17 steps up to the balcony and a further short flight of stairs to the two upstairs rooms.
