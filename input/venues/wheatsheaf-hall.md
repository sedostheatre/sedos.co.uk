## Wheatsheaf Hall

Sedos uses Wheatsheaf Hall as a rehearsal and social venue. We are excited that in June 2024, we will also bring this space to life as a performance venue when Sunday in the Park with George plays there 20-30 June.

Wheatsheaf Hall has been a community venue since 1988 when members of the local community leased the building from the Council. It was awarded Grade II listed status in 1975 and is run by volunteers.

## Your visit to Wheatsheaf Hall

**Address**

Wheatsheaf Hall,\
Wheatsheaf Lane,\
London\
SW8 2UP

**Getting to Wheatsheaf Hall**

The closest tube station to Wheatsheaf is Nine Elms. The venue is also within walking distance of Vauxhall, Stockwell, Oval and Kennington tube stations. Vauxhall is also served by overground trains.

Buses 2 and 88 stop the closest to the venue. A number of other buses also travel along the A3036 and stop near Nine Elms station, just a few minutes walk away.

You cannot park right outside Wheatsheaf Hall – Wheatsheaf Lane is narrow and short, with no turning spaces at the end. If you drive in to drop people off, you will have to back out onto the main road.

**Cashless**

Please note, Sedos is now a cashless operation so we will only take card payments for bar sales when we run events at Wheatsheaf and for programmes and ticket sales on the door when we perform at the venue
