## 1 Brewers' Hall Garden

1 Brewers' Hall Garden (BHG) used to be Sedos' home. It was our main rehearsal space, as well as where we stored and created most of our costumes, props and set. It was also where we held most of our auditions.

Sedos is no longer using BHG. Check audition notices and individual announcements for venues for auditions and other activities.
