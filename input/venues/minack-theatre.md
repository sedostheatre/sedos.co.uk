**Getting to the Minack**

Access to The Minack is via a steep narrow road.  Porthcurno and the lanes nearby are often congested, especially during the holiday season. 

The Minack website advises: Coming from Penzance, satnav will direct you via the B3283 through the village of St. Buryan. This road has narrow sections that frequently get blocked in summer, leading to long delays. We advise you instead to keep on the A30 through Sennen, then keep straight on (ignoring satnav) to the junction with B3315. Turn left onto B3315 and follow signs for The Minack Theatre and Porthcurno.

Parking is free for the duration of your visit, to those visiting the theatre or coming to a performance.

The nearest station is Penzance and the [Land's End Coaster](https://www.firstbus.co.uk/adventures-bus/services/lands-end-coaster) bus service links Penzance and Land’s End and stops in Porthcurno, a ten minute walk from the Theatre.

**Accessibility**

The Minack team aim to make the site available to everyone as far as possible – however the steep, rocky geography of the theatre does create some access limitations.
