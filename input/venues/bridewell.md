## The Bridewell Theatre

Most of our shows take place at the Bridewell Theatre, where we are the resident theatre company. 

The Bridewell Theatre opened in 1994, breathing new life and purpose into a long derelict Victorian swimming pool. Currently it is a “receiving house” — just about anyone can hire the facilities and put on a show here. 

The Bridewell's programme includes shows by amateurs, professionals, colleges, opera companies, magicians and lecturers. Since 2005, it have hosted Lunchbox, a bite-sized slot where local City workers bring their own food and drink to a 45-minute performance. Sedos became the Bridewell's resident theatre company in 2012. 

St Bride Foundation, established in 1891, brings together exhibition spaces, a theatre, educational centre and one of the world’s most significant collections of typography and historical printed reference. It also provides facilities for conference and events.

**Collecting tickets and entering the theatre**

You will need to collect your tickets from the box office when you arrive at the theatre, giving the name the tickets were booked in. The box office opens approximately 45 minutes before curtain up.

The theatre is usually open for audience members to take their seats 10-15 minutes before curtain up. Our seat is unreserved, so audience members claim seats on a first-come, first-served basis. Some shows offer the best seats in the house as premium seating, at a higher price. In this case, there are two blocks of seating — standard and premium. Seats are unreserved within these blocks.

**Bar**

The Bridewell bar is open approximately 45 minutes before performances, at the interval and after the show.

**Latecomers**

In general, audience members arriving late for a Sedos show will be held outside the theatre until a suitable point for admission, when they will be show in by an usher or member of stage crew. You will be shown to the most easily accessible available seat so you will probably not be able to join your party if you arrive late.

Certain shows may not be able to admit latecomers at all or not until the interval, so you are advised to arrive in good time for curtain up.

**Accessibility**

The Bridewell Theatre is accessible through the main entrance via a portable ramp over a threshold stone with a riser height ranging from 110-150mm from right to left. Access from the threshold to the auditorium is via a stairlift (230kg weight load) and to the theatre bar and lavatories via a platform lift (340kg weight load).
