The Bridewell Theatre opened in 1994, breathing new life and purpose into a long derelict Victorian swimming pool. Currently it is a “receiving house” — just about anyone can hire the facilities and put on a show here.

The Bridewell's programme includes shows by amateurs, professionals, colleges, opera companies, magicians and lecturers. Since 2005, it has hosted Lunchbox, a bite-sized slot where local City workers bring their own food and drink to a 45-minute performance. Sedos became the Bridewell's resident theatre company in 2012.

St Bride Foundation, established in 1891, brings together exhibition spaces, a theatre, educational centre and one of the world’s most significant collections of typography and historical printed reference. It also provides facilities for conference and events.

**Tickets and entering the theatre**

Your tickets will be sent by email if you book online. You do not need to print your tickets – it's fine to show them on a mobile phone at the door.

The theatre is usually open for audience members to take their seats 10-15 minutes before curtain up.

If the performance is not sold out, tickets can be bought at the box office at the theatre from around 30 minutes before curtain up.

**Bar**

The Bridewell bar is open approximately 45 minutes before performances, at the interval and after the show.

**Latecomers**

In general, audience members arriving late for a Sedos show will be held outside the theatre until a suitable point for admission, when they will be show in by an usher or member of stage crew. You will be shown to the most easily accessible available seat so you will probably not be able to join your party if you arrive late.

Certain shows may not be able to admit latecomers at all or not until the interval, so you are advised to arrive in good time for curtain up.

**Cashless**

Please note, Sedos is now a cashless operation so we will only take card payments for programmes and ticket sales on the door. The Bridewell Theatre also operates cashless, so all bar sales are made by card payments.

**Accessibility**

The Bridewell Theatre is accessible through the main entrance via a portable ramp over a threshold stone with a riser height ranging from 110-150mm from right to left. Access from the threshold to the auditorium is via a stairlift (230kg weight load) and to the theatre bar and lavatories via a platform lift (340kg weight load).
