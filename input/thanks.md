Everything we do at Sedos is the work of volunteers, from building this website to putting on all our shows. It's a team effort. 

Weâ€™d like to thank:

* The past and present members of the Sedos management committee and trustees
* The members of our marketing, production and membership groups
* The past and present team at the Bridewell Theatre, where we are the resident theatre company
* Olly Levett for building this website
* All the photographers who take pictures of our shows and whose images make this website look great, including: Michael Smith, David Ovenden, Stephen Russell, Adrian Hau, Nick Chronnell, Neil Ballinger, Ruth Anthony and Dancers of London
