**Box office**

[You will find our online box office here.](https://sedos.ticketsolve.com)

**Ticket Collection**

Your tickets will be sent by email if you book online. You do not need to print your tickets – it's fine to show them on a mobile phone at the door.

The theatre is usually open for audience members to take their seats 10-15 minutes before curtain up.

If the performance is not sold out, tickets can be bought at the box office at the theatre from around 30 minutes before curtain up.

**Latecomers**

In general, audience members arriving late for a Sedos show will be held outside the theatre until a suitable point for admission, when they will be show in by an usher or member of stage crew. You will be shown to the most easily accessible available seat so you will probably not be able to join your party if you arrive late.

Certain shows may not be able to admit latecomers at all or not until the interval, so you are advised to arrive in good time for curtain up.

**Concession**

Sedos members, seniors and OAPs, children, students over 16 with valid identification, registered disabled and registered unemployed unless otherwise stated, for example Gala Nights.

**Venue**

Most of our shows are performed at the [Bridewell Theatre,](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) Bride Lane, London EC4Y 8EQ.
