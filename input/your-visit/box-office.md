**In light of the announcement by the Government on 16 March 2020, with much sadness, we have taken the difficult but responsible decision to suspend our operations for the time being and postpone all upcoming events.**

**Ticket Collection:**

Tickets will be available for you to collect from the Box Office on the night of the performance. They will not be posted out to you.

**Latecomers:**

In general, audience members arriving late for a Sedos show will be held outside the theatre until a suitable point for admission, when they will be show in by an usher or member of stage crew. You will be shown to the most easily accessible available seat so you will probably not be able to join your party if you arrive late.

Certain shows may not be able to admit latecomers at all or not until the interval, so you are advised to arrive in good time for curtain up.

**Concessions:**

Sedos members, seniors and OAPs, children, students over 16 with valid identification, registered disabled and registered unemployed unless otherwise stated, for example Gala Nights.

**Venue:**

Most of our 2020 season will be performed at the Bridewell Theatre, Bride Lane, Blackfriars EC4Y 8EQ. Seats at the Bridewell Theatre are unreserved.
