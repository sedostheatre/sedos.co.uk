# **2005**

## *Company*

>Sedos's production was cleverly directed by Roger Harwood, making great use of the space and artfully supported by a tight, nine-piece orchestra and superb Musical Director. Ensemble work was superb – the cast were all working together and most importantly, listening to each other which is a must for any of Sondheim’s musically challenging pieces...it was an entertaining, admirable effort for which Sedos is to be congratulated.

## *Six Degrees of Separation*

>In Luke Simond’s production John Guare’s highly polished exploration gets some added emotional charge from strong performances by Katey D’Ancona and Joespeh Coelho

## *Jekyll & Hyde*

>The cast give enthusiastic performances ... David Griffiths' musical direction produces strong chorus pieces and solo performances. Direction, from Dan Chasemore and Chloe Faine, results in all cast members maintaining their characters within and between scenes.
