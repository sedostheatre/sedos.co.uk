# **2010**

## *Kiss of the Spider Woman: The Musical*

> Sedos is generally, and I would say correctly, regarded as the best amateur theatre company in London… And so I had high expectations of the opening night… In short, it's fantastic… kudos to Sedos for an unconventional selection which has been pulled off in (their now trademark) style…

## *The Tragedy of the Prince of Denmark*

>An intelligently adapted version of the play...and a slick use of multimedia.... Worth a watch whether you're a seasoned Shakey fan or a newbie.... manages to bring some interesting & original touches to an obviously heavily recycled show.

>Adam Moulder as Hamlet impresses.

>Carolina Main as Ophelia is excellent. She lifts the language while still retaining the very modern, ‘realistic’ style of playing chosen for this production.... an interesting adaptation and likely to stimulate debate among those who know Hamlet already.

## *The Libertine*

>(An) unorthodox approach to this story of a highly unorthodox man.... The use of the Grotesque Chorus in demonstrating bits of back-story is clever, and unique choreography by Leigh Tredger and Angus Jacobs allows the chorus to transition effortlessly from individual entities into one concise unit. Still, the highlight is the playful, satirical humour that courses through the first half and is at its finest when Rochester, Sebastien Blanc as George Etheredge, and Mark Macey as Charles Sackville share the stage. Rebecca Weymouth’s fine portrayal of Jane is also of note.

>Luke Trebilcock is outstanding in the physically and emotionally demanding lead role, creating a wholly credible seventeenth-century libertine. James Hannant’s low-key witty vulgarity as Wilmot’s down-at-heel servant strikes a pleasingly ironic note, and the ...delectable Brooke Petersen is utterly convincing as the earl's mistress and inept stage-actress.
