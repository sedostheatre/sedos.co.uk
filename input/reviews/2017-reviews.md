## *The Drowsy Chaperone*

>This is a brilliant, brilliant show that has always deserved to be seen. In the case of this production, more so than ever.

>The Drowsy Chaperone may be categorised as an amateur level production, but it didn’t show. The quality of this production was fantastic and truly entertaining.

>I feel as if I am constantly saying this about Sedos, but they really have got amateur theatre right and the Drowsy Chaperone is yet another example of this.

## *Little Women The Musical*

>The beautiful set design for Sedos’ production, the sheer talent of those playing the March sisters and the clever direction means that I took this award.

>On realising that I was going to watch an amateur production I embarrassingly didn’t have high hopes for this production of Little Women the Musical – however, within the first few lines, I was proven very wrong. The Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society – better known as Sedos – are an amateur company who I now realise deliver professional standard productions.

>Watching [Jonathon] Cooper’s character progression and journey throughout the whole show was, I felt, a master class in acting.

>What is immediately apparent is that the ‘stars’ of this show are the designers.

>As always, Sedos deserve top marks for their production values.

## *Priscilla Queen of the Desert*

>A quick exit-poll on the audience provided comments such as 'exuberant', 'brilliant', 'didn't want it to end' and 'you'll regret not seeing it.' My favourite has to be 'very pink and gay, but the best kind of gay.' Congratulations to Director / Costume Designer Angus Jacobs, Musical Director Ryan Macaulay and the whole creative team. It might not be as glittery or explosive as a big-budget West End version but it's just as fabulous.

>Overall, then I guess it’s pretty obvious I enjoyed Priscilla Queen of the Desert. Sedos have put together and delivered a first-rate show that is fun with a capital ‘F’ and entertaining with a capital ‘E’ from start to finish.
