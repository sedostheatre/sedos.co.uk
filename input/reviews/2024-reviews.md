^^^ The Color Purple

>Sedos and the team behind The Color Purple have a huge amount of be proud of with this show, not only for being a society to put black stories front and centre but for doing so with such success, from the tickets sales through to the talent on stage and the creative team vision. The Color Purple is a stunning production and the fact that it focuses on under represented voices in amateur theatre is the cherry on top of the cake.

>Sedos has achieved something remarkable with this production of The Color Purple. With fantastic performances, thoughtful direction and an abundance of energy, this was a moving and inspiring piece of theatre that I am grateful to have watched.

^^^ You’re A Good Man, Charlie Brown

>This play is charm personified, an absolutely delightful, whimsical and hilarious production that manages to be simplistic but also extremely clever. If you’ve even the vaguest fondness for musical theatre this is a must see, and Sedos have once again proven that they’re more than capable of producing professional quality theatre of the highest order.

>Director Mark Siddall had cleverly created a 2D world to echo the origins of the musical, enhanced by a clever set design by Andrew Laidlaw and Mark Steward… The cast were unwavering in their commitment and had really understood the brief that they were not only playing children but playing children from a comic book… Overall Sedos understood the brief for this show well, embrace the inner child that we all have and let that play out on stage… the creativity and commitment from the cast and production team really helped make this a fun night discovering a show for the first time.

^^^ Sunday in the Park with George

>This production was blessed with two outstanding leads in Will de Renzy-Martin (George) and Sadie Kempner (Dot)… Sunday In the Park with George was an excellent production overall which should satisfy the most ardent fans of Stephen Sondheim whilst engaging anyone for whom it will be a first time view.

>If you go INTO THE WOODS  on Sunday, you’re sure of a big surprise! No teddy bears picnicking there but a most stupendous show, the best production of a Sondheim musical I have ever seen.

>It’s standing ovation time for Sugarman [as Richard]…  leading a very talented cast of great players.  Summing up, Sedos have done it again with Richard III. Every time I see this company I leave the theatre impressed, and this was no exception

>The choice of reoccurring news bulletins being flashed up… really helps to hammer home important plot points and makes this play much more accessible to those that may not typically be a fan of the Bard… a very interesting take on it, performed by accomplished actors… well worth seeing.

## *Just So*

^^^ Just So

>I don’t speak any ancient languages, but in my mind, the word Sedos doesn’t stand for the Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society but is, in fact, the Greek word for ‘Really Delivers’ because that’s what they have done once again. I really loved this production of Just So from start to finish… Was there anything about the show I didn’t like, or thought could be improved? Well, no. The show worked on every level and hearing one of the few pieces of poetry I like “If” being put to music was really the icing on the cake. Another superb production and a fabulous night out brought to you by this most unamateur of Amdram companies.

>I never fail to note the strong ensemble work of Sedos’ shows and this is no exception. There isn’t a single weak link in the cast… The production is also blessed with some simple but clever design work… Whilst some critics delight in subtracting stars for their personal reservations with ‘books’, I prefer to concentrate on the quality of, in this case, a highly inventive, charming and polished revival of an unusual British musical.

>Overall Just So was another Sedos success, an incredibly strong cast combined with a well executed creative vision ensured that I left the theatre grinning from ear to ear.
