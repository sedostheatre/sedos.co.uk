^^^ Guys and Dolls

>In the grand scheme of amateur, fringe and professional musicals, this cast perform to the absolute max with passion and humour throughout. Moreover, everyone looks like they’re having a great time doing it. London audiences should take notice of Sedos, as its creatives are clearly more than capable of giving their professional neighbours a run for their money.

>The bar for performance level has been set so high by countless previous productions that every new interpretation of the piece has a daunting task to match expectations and standards. Sedos… rose to the challenge with a confident, sure footed, vibrant and stylish performance, and emerged with full honours.

>…an inventive, energetic, comedic and enjoyable musical because of the love of the material and attention to detail. The small space is home to a big ensemble of talent, expertly choreographed by Thomas Leonard in such a way that regularly leaves the audience breathless… This is a high-quality production of a favourite musical…

## *As You Like It*

>The Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society excels once again with their innovative and unusual one-hour production of Shakepeare's As You Like… The production has been designed and executed in a truly professional manner demonstrating there is no shortage of highly talented players active in amateur theatre.

>Told by those who evidently have a deep set understanding and respect for the text, the story is excellently executed so that not a line is out of place or superfluous to their storytelling cause. The overall design was incredibly creative and brilliantly executed… There are no weak performances from any member of the cast, each an integral link in a strong company… Sedos is so close to being professional it hurts. Outstandingly polished performances, brilliant direction and joy in creating theatrical masterpieces makes these young actors ones to watch.

>Sedos’ version of this classic play is silly, sweet, and very witty.

## *Baby*

> Sedos… produced a production that not only had incredible production standards, but left me wondering why this gem of a show has been languishing for so long… Musically, the show was kept bouncing along under the baton of David Winters, whose 5 piece band were superb… Major kudos must go to Sedos for nurturing and producing what can only be called a stunning production. I just wish it were running for another week so I could go at least a few more times. Baby left me with a lump in my throat. It exceeded myevery expectation and left me wanting more. Exceptional!!

## *Spring Awakening*

> Within thirty seconds it was very obvious that this is no ordinary amateur company. The Sedos production ofSpring Awakeningwas executed in atotally professional manner leaving little doubt that amateur theatre can be every bit as good as professional theatre, and in this case, even better.

> If this high standard can be achieved from evening rehearsals from a cast of enthusiasts then I think producers and actors across the profession may need to pull their socks up and take note.

> The entire cast were completely and utterly mesmerising; lively, engaging and full of energy. Every single cast member gave a strong all-round performance, but it was the singing that really made this a night to remember, the harmonies absolutely gave me chills… this production of Spring Awakeningis smart, sexy and seriously packs a punch. Don’t miss it.

> [Spring Awakening is] performed by Sedos, a well-established amateur company who strive to produce theatre which can stand shoulder to shoulder with professional productions. In that,Spring Awakeningsucceeds admirably.

> Chris Warner (director) and Max Wolf (creative director) should be justifiably proud of this production. They have chosen not to carbon copy the original production but instead create their own vision and that is to be applauded… on the night I attended, mature adults were visibly moved to tears.

## *Three Sisters*

> There is little evidence of Sedos theatre company's amateur status in its charming production which neatly balances the characters' loneliness and frustration with a sense of hope and humour.
><footer><cite>Three Sisters, 2012, One Stop Arts</cite></footer>

> As the first show of 2012 for Sedos, Three Sisters rewards before it begins, by presenting the audience with a stunning set... the scale of the thing was impressive... The use of the depth of the stage at the Bridewell was a brilliant and brave move on the director's part, giving opportunity to place the actors as a framed piece of art.
