^^^ Such Stuff As Dreams Are Made On

>I would give the show as many stars as possible and think everyone in London should see this show… I encourage, urge and plead with you to go, because I guarantee you will not have seen anything like this before. Whoever is in charge of awards that the folks at Sedos would be eligible for, book your ticket now!

>Such Stuff as Dreams are Made on is absolutely fantastic… a truly fantastic show that will play with your mind and blow you away from the moment it starts until you once more leave the building and re-enter the real world which, for a while will seem a little less colourful than it was before.

## *Reefer Madness*

>I applaud Sedos for taking a risk and producing this little known show and encourage those who want to spend the night laughing at inappropriate jokes to get themselves along to the Bridewell.

## *Whose Life Is It Anyway?*

>A riveting couple of hours… this is a thought-provoking and thoroughly entertaining piece of theatre about a highly sensitive and controversial subject.

>A very stylish and smart production of an intriguing gem of a musical... [Sedos] creates something that is touching, funny, uncomfortable and thought-provoking.

## *One Man, Two Guvnors*

>I have seen quite a lot of Sedos productions over the last few years, and their shows are of a consistent excellent quality. They are undoubtedly a collection of extremely talented directors, actors and performers. One Man, Two Guv’nors upheld that high expectation and did not disappoint; the show was of professional standard with even the smallest parts giving consistent high quality performances.

>Sedos is an amateur dramatic company, but the acting is easily on par with the professional show I saw previously. In fact, having seen Sedos in action before, it seems they are once again blurring the lines between professional and amateur theatre. In particular, they prove that the quality of a show is determined by those involved – and not whether anyone is getting paid.

## *Candide*

>The result is an irreverent, apt, ever topical musical… it’s in excellent hands with Sedos which, as usual, achieves a near professional standard… A jolly good evening’s entertainment, then. All credit to this production and all who sail in her.

>Sedos delivered the production in a classy manner with an incredibly strong cast in everything from their characterisation to music and a strong visual feast for the eyes.

## *Pornography*

>Sedos are one of the countries best amateur dramatic groups.... I do admire how versatile Sedos can be from stunning productions of musicals...to clever and infrequently performed plays such as Pornography.
