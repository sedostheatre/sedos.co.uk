^^^ Amadeus

>Sedos is one of those theatre companies that never seem to disappoint and their current production of Amadeus, running at The Bridewell Theatre, is no exception. Sedos once again show their skill in taking a well-loved play and presenting it in an innovative and entertaining fashion.... Excellent production by the talented members of Sedos.

>This is an outstanding production by this super-talented company.... They certainly have nailed it. It was right every time. Exciting, intriguing, a snappy production with never a dull moment. Brilliant!

## *Carrie: The Musical*

^^^ Carrie: The Musical

>The displays of telekinesis in action are worth seeing, as are the prom costumes. This is amateur dramatics at its finest: forget backing tracks – Rob Archibald leads a seven-piece band – and it’s difficult to pick a stand-out performance in a cast so finely balanced. The shock horror factor may not be prevalent, but the portrayal of bullying, intimidation and a sense of not fitting in is more than sufficiently disconcerting. Not one for the fainthearted.

>There are clearly many technical elements needed for a show like Carrie in order to display her telekinesis and whilst I do not want to give any spoilers away Sedos interpretation of this was exceptional. It meant that Carrie’s moments where her telekinesis flared up were some of my highlights of the show. I must commend Chris Adams and Paul Brookland Williams (director and movement director) for the courage to take this route as well as Polly Hayes for her vital part in it. Other elements such as flashing lights and windows slamming shut were all well thought out and timed well to add to the suspense of the show. Once again Sedos have presented a rarely performed musical to a wider audience and judging from the sell out audiences I was not the only one excited by this. With a talented cast and a strong direction for the piece Sedos have once again presented a show that I would urge people to see….. if it wasn’t sold out already!

>Just as you think you’ve seen the very best Sedos has to offer they give us something even better. It’s a good musical but Sedos has turned it into something extraordinary. Brilliant! The audience were gripped from the opening moment to the final curtain calls.

>As ever, Sedos bring their customary skill and ability to the performance, the ensemble songs in particular being tightly controlled, crisply delivered and well sung, with excellent work from Movement Director Paul Brookland Williams.

>Every ingredient of the production… is of a high standard. A brave and exciting show!

>This show fits no boxes – because it doesn’t have to – and almost creates its own theatre category. The only worry I had about it was that it might push the boundaries too much and end up being almost a panto. Luckily, it stays away from that. I believe Shakespeare, who was a visionary himself, would approve of this type of variation of his drama. It’s just a wild, frivolous show!

^^^ Love! Valour! Compassion!

>It is a well-written piece that given everything the world has gone through in the last two years is very relevant and raises questions of worldwide healthcare priorities in relation to developing cures for pandemics. Sedos are to be congratulated for this production of Love! Valour! Compassion! which has been off the stage for way too long

^^^ American Idiot

>This is not a show for the faint hearted but one that should be seen. If you want a show with poignant commentary on society in an unapologetic bold manner then American Idiot by Sedos will be the show you are looking for. With a cast that have stunning rock vocal abilities and a staging that completes the rock vibe, Sedos have once again delivered.
><footer><cite><a target="_blank" href="http://musicaltheatremusings.co.uk/american-idiot-sedos">American Idiot, 2022, Musical Theatre Musings</a></cite></footer>

>The song performance aspects of the piece were met with the strong cast all round - many of which are destined for a bigger stage - who took them on with electric intensity… Having an incredible live band brought that extra dynamic that brought immense power when combined with the full company in particular. The choreography by Jen Bullock was enticing and worked well with the stage given, as well as the road cases used as the main props throughout. Furthermore, the lighting, designed by Olly Levett, was used effectively in conjunction with this… Loaded with the great track list including 'Jesus of Suburbia', 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams', 'Holiday', 'Wake Me Up When September Ends' and of course, 'American Idiot', plus an additional beautiful surprise encore, this show will undoubtedly leave you unapologetically humming them for at least a week afterwards. This version of American Idiot, directed by Matt Bentley, is one of Sedos’s best shows yet.

## *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*

^^^ The Mystery of Edwin Drood

>This marvellous production demonstrates beyond doubt that the depth of talent we have in London is astonishing. Sedos (the Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society, founded in 1905) have put together a show of West End quality. The self-confidence, versatility and sheer joy of performing shown by every cast member is inspiring and uplifting. With very limited resources they turn minuses into pluses, overcome every challenge with aplomb and deliver entertainment with an unmatched joie de vivre… It would be hard to improve on this. Catch it if you can.

>In my eyes, Sedos is fast developing a reputation for staging shows which easily match the quality of many of the productions that the West End has to offer right now. With a phenomenal cast and perfectly executed musical numbers, it’s no mystery why I found this show so thoroughly entertaining.

## *When the Rain Stops Falling*

![Dress rehearsal image of Sedos’ 2022 production of When the Rain Stops Falling](/assets/51897470424_dbf4c3c68a_knew.jpg)
^^^ When the Rain Stops Falling

>Sedos have once again managed to gather a group of talented performers who embrace the challenges of this complex narrative where younger and older versions of the same character share the acting space… this is an ensemble piece, with all cast on stage at all times. Their seamless joining up of the scenes as they move through time and space is brilliantly executed and allows the audience to follow the complexity of the plot with ease… The multifunctional set with hanging window, large oval table and useful blocks either side of the stage, provide the perfect vehicle to allow the scenes to flow seamlessly between past and present. The beautifully choreographed opening when the cast move from the gallery, armed with umbrellas and coats that are deposited on a hat stand, the simplicity of the costumes which suit the period and keep the audience aware as the scenes move through time, all worked together to help create a show that totally engages the audience… It is the sound and lighting, however, that really draw together the different threads and keep us aware of the fact that this is a play whose themes resonate through the generations… Bovell’s play is not for the faint hearted and it is to the credit of the performers, director Helena Bumpus and assistant director, Lloyd Smith, that by the end of the production, as all the characters gather together, the loose ends have been woven in and we see the complete picture

>Sedos’ production does a wonderful job leading us through the puzzle, ensuring the experience treads the right line of mystery without confusion… Of particular note is the immense production value of this ‘amateur’ show. The borderless set supports well the fluidity of the piece as it drifts across time and space. The lighting is inventive and atmospheric, accenting the narrative structure with flickering lights as we cross a boundary into a different storyline and providing starry nights in the Australian outback. Music is used deftly throughout the piece, binding the different worlds with a perpetual stormy underscore and swelling cinematically at key moments. These all came together well to elevate the show into the relatively cavernous space at the Bridewell… this was a solid production of a challenging play.

>Transitions between scenes, and discipline with regards to the movement of characters in and out of their parts is highly commendable, which is directed by Kimberly Barker, along with the lighting use that faultlessly works in conjunction with this. To imitate snow or stars, and with other appearances throughout, lighting designer, Olly Levett, does a lovely job with navigating these. The thunder and lightning that accompany the constant rainfall is a fitting addition too.
