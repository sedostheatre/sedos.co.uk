^^^ Ragtime

>Many groups would not be able to cast this show, let alone put it on stage, but Sedos can do so and with verve and invention in Matt Gould’s pacy and intelligent production, managing his cast of 32 well and ensuring that the complex storyline is at all times as clear as possible. MD Ryan Macaulay conducts an 18-piece orchestra and it is a delight to hear this score played so well and in these orchestrations. Choreography from Victoria Louise-Currie and Rachel Elfassy-Bitoun is nicely differentiated for the various groups and makes good use of the multi-layered set.

>This is a truly outstanding production, lively, slick and colourful. Although Sedos describes itself as “amateur” there’s little doubt that their attitude to every production is totally professional.

>Sedos manage to execute a perfect reading of a challenging score with multiple scene transitions.

>Sedos have achieved another high class and polished performance in Ragtime. It managed to move me from anger to sadness and send shivers down my spine throughout.

>There is too much good about this production to sum it all up in one short review but if you are a fan of the bombastic in musical theatre. *Ragtime* is a must see and you never know when you might have the opportunity again with such a rarely performed work. Sedos have bravely taken a risk on this one and it has paid off in spades. An accomplished piece of theatre executed by an accomplished group of peoples whose love of the art shines through in everything they do.

>This Sedos production is a marvel and is not just an excellent amateur production. It is genuinely one of the best shows to grace a London stage this year.

>It is shocking to me that this production is Amateur Dramatics, as the quality of the performances, the costumes, lighting, orchestra, and production quality is very high.

>An orchestra of eighteen and a cast of thirty-two is impressive for the West End these days, let alone amateur dramatics. The production team is worth a mention as well, for several reasons… It is difficult to balance out the sound with a cast and an orchestra as large as this, but the techies here do a remarkable job, with not a single lyric or line of spoken dialogue missed thanks to each and every microphone functioning as it should throughout.

>Sedos have created a captivating and heartbreaking production which should stay with you long after you leave the theatre. You’d be hard pressed to find such an abundance of talent elsewhere in the West End.

## *Dangerous Liaisons*

>As a long-time fan of Sedos, I was excited to be able to attend the first night of their first full dance production… Rest assured, my expectations were exceeded on both counts as the evening unfolded into a masterclass of dramatic contemporary dance which fully captured the themes of seduction and revenge of the original play. Each Sedos season showcases a range of plays and musicals, from popular, well-loved classics to lesser-known and newer works which can challenge both cast and audience. Their weekly Sedance class obviously attracts enthusiastic and highly competent dancers, and the decision to use this to add a new artform to their repertoire was brilliant and will hopefully herald more in the future. I can only add that they have set the bar very high with this one… It was a fantastic experience to be in the performance space with the dancers, feeling their every breath, absorbing their energy and watching the skill of their performance. Congratulations to everyone involved for the faith in what you were creating - you achieved what you set out to do with bells on!

>A performance of this style is incredibly ambitious for any professional dance troop. What makes this more impressive is that an amateur dramatics society created all of this. Sedos are known for their incredibly high-quality shows, but Dangerous Liaisons has put them on a whole different level. This production with these incredible performers would not be out of place on a West End stage.

>The dancing is gorgeous, athletic and very expressive. The performance space is tiny, so you are up close and personal with the dancers/actors, and they absolutely carry you along with the story… Sedos is an amateur company, but there is nothing amateurish about this show – it’s ambitious, clever and exciting, but also beautifully economical and precise.

## [](https://www.londontheatre1.com/reviews/musical/stiles-drewes-soho-cinders-at-the-bridewell-theatre/)*Arms and the Man*

>Produced by the technically amateur Sedos theatre company this is another production from them which deserves a transfer to the West End. It’s a smart, witty and thoughtful play, beautifully acted and staged.

## *Soho Cinders*

>A hearty and sincere production, it’s a more complex story than the traditional fairy-tale from which it is adapted, but it’s a lively and engaging one at that.

## *A Swell Party*

>This production, a Minack debut for Sedos which usually performs just off Fleet Street, classily directed by Roger Harwood and Dawn Harrison-Wallace, dances us through his amazing, sometimes outrageous, ultimately poignant life story, on a triumph of an Art Deco set designed by Steven King… This is glamour with bucketfuls of fizz, and a feeling of extravagant luxury washes over us as the Sedos singers seemingly effortlessly swing through around 50 famous numbers with on-stage pianists, musical director Matt Gould and Ryan Macaulay, the brilliant Annette Brown tooting and drumming, and the Minack’s executive director Zoe Curnow having her own party on double bass. Matt and Ryan are a delightful duo, tap dancing too, with narration by the ultra smooth James Franey as Cole, joined by Liz Flint as his wife Linda in shimmering emerald silk, backed by Stephen Beeney, Susan Booth, Rachel Elfassy-Bitoun, Will Garood, Deborah Lean, Yvette Shiel and Alex Yelland.Producer Lizzie Levett, choreographer Jane Saunders, sound and lighting Adam Coppard and Olly Levett, and stage manager Andrew Laidlaw and team make it all so believable. When’s the next party?

## *How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying*

>Quite simply, the show is wonderful and should serve as a shining beacon throughout across the entire non-professional sector. Whether you see the same show produced at at the Union Theatre, Young Vic, Charing Cross Theatre, Jermyn Street Theatre or any other professional off-West End/Fringe venue, it will not get any better than this. Amateur groups around the capital pay attention; this is how to put on a musical! This fifty-eight-year-old show (which also played the West End in 1963) makes a fitting return to London and is probably as close to earning a ‘professional’ tag as you can get.

>A magnificent cast make nonsense of their amateur status performing with charm and humour. A basic but still adequate set is the only sign of Sedos’ amdram status. Even so, I’ve never seen such rapid set changes with props moved into place so quickly you wouldn’t have noticed them. This is a production that could easily be dropped into the West End without any noticeable difference; a thoroughly professional production that ticked all the right boxes.

>Sedos’ production of How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying is a great chance to see this musical, with bundles of comedy and a cast that excel in getting their character across I would recommend getting yourselves down to the Bridewell Theatre.

>Once again, Sedos have a hit on their hands. The level of this show is something that you would expect from a London production. The fact that the cast is made up of amateurs that all have separate day jobs makes it even more impressive.

## *After the Dance*

>Overall, this is an entertaining and thought-provoking revival that does justice to Rattigan’s neglected work.

>The production, typical of Sedos, is more professional than their amateur dramatics moniker might imply, and is certainly one to consider if you’re a nearby City worker keen to take in some fringe theatre that certainly punches above its weight.

## *Next Thing You Know*

>Sedos have a reputation for delivering West End quality in every production, and it certainly shows here. The work that has gone into the show is visible in every second, from the slick set changes, to the choreography, to the songs, Sedos pull out all the stops to present a fantastically designed, well performed evening’s entertainment with a few kooky interactive elements thrown in.

>An impressive set, a solid cast and imaginative immersive theatre made for a fun night out.
><footer><cite><a target="_blank" href="http://musicaltheatremusings.co.uk/next-thing-you-know">Next Thing You Know, 2019, Musical Theatre Musings</a></cite></footer>

>Interspersed with song and with a very cleverly designed set that allowed the bar to also be an office and a bedroom with very little changeover or delay, the production was as close to top quality as I’ve seen in a while. Mix this up with the skilled acting and comfortable immersive experience and I would confidently recommend Next Thing You Know. A very enjoyable evening’s entertainment indeed.

>Sedos never cease to amaze with their production values, creating polished shows that you forget are by an amateur company. For NTYK, the theatre is transformed into Sullivan Street Tavern in New York. Mingling at the bar with the regulars until last orders is rung to get the audience into their seats, the ambience is brilliant, and the set design team deserve at least 10 stars for their authentic and detailed realisation of a bar that is instantly recognisable to anyone who watches New York set TV shows. The staging is wonderfully thought out and director Dan Saunders has created a special atmosphere.

## *Baal*

>I can think of few amateur companies who would, or could, take on the challenge of Brecht’s first play but ever-versatile, adventurous Sedos have staged it with confidence, verve and a lot of talent.
