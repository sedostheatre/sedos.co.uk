^^^ A Little Night Music

>[Sedos] should be credited as one of the premier [amateur] companies in the country, as their track record for staging professional-standard shows proves… it was a genius stroke by co-directors Roger Harwood and Dawn Harrison-Wallace to stage the entire show as a flashback… the casting was difficult to fault… [the cast] all did a great job of bringing the show to life… top marks must go to the costume team for their fantastic work… [musical director] David Griffiths and his musicians gave a performance grander than many of those you'd hear in West End theatres… Congratulations again to Sedos for another great production…

## *The Last Days of Judas Iscariot*

> Billed as an amateur production, the Sedos’ cast are anything but. The clever staging and superb costumes only amplify the wonderful work being put in by the actors… A production that does real justice to the writing and ethos of the play, this is one you will be loath to miss…

## *Assassins*

> The amateur production I refer to was the very professionally staged version by Sedos… As dry and as sterile as this group may sound (bankers, dancing?), the talent involved was phenomenal… The cast, for one, was perfectly formed… everyone did a fantastic job, all the more incredible when you realise that this was an amateur production…

> Sedos’ reputation for bringing high-quality productions to London’s off-West End theatres goes before them and if their production of Assassins is anything to go by, it is a reputation they truly deserve… the accents, excellent vocals and good characterisation were held throughout by each of the lead performers and the ensemble players too…

> Assassins is rarely staged well and you be hard pressed to find a better amateur production. Kudos to Sedos!!

## *Arcadia*

> The simple set worked well for both times and was believable… It is always a joy to go and see well acted and well directed theatre… The audience could tell [the actors] understood what their characters were saying and why they had to say it… All the performances were strong and retained their originality… Overall a great piece…
