# **2006**

## *Merrily We Roll Along*

>As compelling as the Donmar's [production] a few years ago

>Mickey Killianey was a convincingly likeable and human Franklin Shepherd - oxymora, if ever two were more apparent! This was no mean feat and also overcame one of the difficulties of the piece: that we meet the main characters at their worst and so do not find it easy to empathise with them as, or until, they become nicer/younger in the second act… For me the hero(ine) of the piece is Mary. Mary is the glue that makes sense of the relationships and really breaks your heart with Not a Day Goes By, even though you think Beth (Bridget Cross) had already done that on the steps of the divorce court. And here Chloë Faine got my vote from the opening; here was a woman who had been on a journey and I wanted to witness it. Right on cue my heart was duly broken - again.

## *Bash*

>Fantastic play - really absorbing. I thought it was one of the very best plays I have ever seen. Will Harrison-Wallace gave an outstanding performance

>Completely riveting and gobsmackingly good acting - pulls no punches, a dark glimpse into the sides of people we'd rather not see. Still get the heebie-jeebies just thinking about it! NOT TO BE MISSED!

>Dark, shocking and compelling - I loved this play! The performances were outstanding - which helped create the desired audience involvement in an almost voyeuristic way! Very clever, and thoroughly enjoyable!

## *The Shape of Things*

>Ohmigod - I can't believe this isn't in the West End. It's completely compelling! Don't go to some rubbish musical in some huge barn of a theatre - go and see this instead and see what theatre can be like when people really put their hearts into it!

>It was a scorching hot and stuffy Tuesday evening in The City; it was going to take something pretty spectacular to make me sit still for 3 hours in a sparse, humid basement theatre. Needless to say, it was and it did! Thoroughly entertaining; a super performance by all concerned. Thought provoking and entertaining.

>Superb show! One of the best things I have seen in London for some time. Pitched perfectly, and cleverly reworked for a British audience. Great performances all round, with special mentions for Jenny, played with a bubby sexiness, and a phenomenal Adam, who was played with a subtlety and likability that made the final scene absolutely heart wrenching. I was riveted throughout - and I only found out afterwards, that this was an amateur company! The west end better pull its socks up!

## *Much Ado About Nothing*

>Clever and funny

## *City of Angels*

>Bobbi/Gabby is phenomenal and both the stones/stines are gorgeous

>Absolutely Fantastic - only found out in the interval it was an amateur production! I'd have never realised otherwise! All performances were excellent, but especially impressed with Bobbi and Buddy. Brilliant!
