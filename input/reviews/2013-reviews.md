# **2013**

## *Hot Mikado*

>Sedos certainly takes the spirit of the piece and entertained the audience with a sizzling production and a great night out. From the opening number when the scantily clad ladies of Japan burst onto the stage to the grand finale the company combined set, costume, staging and lighting with some brilliant performances to provide an excellent night out…

>In a time of talentless reality TV shows, spending a Saturday evening watching some genuine talent is a breath of fresh air. Observing such an obviously hard-working cast put together such an effervescent show is exciting and thrilling, making this the light-hearted fun that musical theatre often misses the mark with. You’ll have ‘Three Little Maids’ stuck in your head all week…

>This production of Hot Mikado by the Sedos theatre company is a little jewel that you should not miss and that hopefully will find a bigger showcase and a re-run (a longer run!) at the Bridewell Theatre or, why not?, a bigger location! (anyone reading there???)… The run (for now) is short and you should not miss it but I am pretty sure someone will notice this show and hopefully we’ll get new dates. It really is worth it — get your tickets…

> The cast remain totally focussed throughout the show. Their tight harmonies and excellent diction combine with strong and varied dance routines to give us a thoroughly enjoyable and beautifully costumed performance. Sedos know exactly how to capture an audience, hold it firmly in the palms of their hands, and then send it on its way, humming those compulsive ear worms – the catchy tunes you just can’t get out of your head…

## *Macbeth*

^^^ Macbeth

>As soon as the play began the commitment of every actor hit you in the face with every inch of stage swarming with character, character that as the play progressed and actors doubled up on parts, was never lost. Every line, every performer… absolutely deserved their every moment and created a performance well beyond the level of the amateur theatre… So many performances stood out… All the costumes were beyond fantastic and Deborah Lean’s mixing of military, Scottish and the Elizabethan was seamlessly done, including the translation of set design to costume… Final praise, however, has to go to Chloë Faine’s directing. Also credited as designer, her vision is seamlessly woven through performance, costume, blocking, set design and everything else. This production was meticulously thought out, and it shows… Sedos has set theMacbethbar exceptionally high.

>Praising a production for the quality of the costumes, design or special effects is sometimes seen as rather a backhanded compliment. While this can be true, it is easy to forget that theatre is a visual medium, and so such elements are a legitimate part of the spectacle. In the case of Sedos’ Steampunk inspiredMacbeth, at the Bridewell Theatre, the production values are far beyond anything else you are likely to see on the fringe stage. Indeed, they put large parts of the West End to shame…Director Chloe Faine and Matt Gould (who produced the show) should congratulate themselves on a job well done, along with the rest of the cast and crew.

## *A Man of No Importance*

>As an example of total theatricality, I think it is very hard to better this show… the whole cast demonstrated a particularly high standard of singing and the accents were accurate (I commend Sedos for seeking help with this often-overlooked aspect) and consistent… in summary this was a very fine production of this very fine musical.

>The show is very much an ensemble piece, and it seems invidious to single out single performances, when there really isn’t a weak link in the cast… Congratulations to all involved.

## *Autobahn*

>The acting is top-notch, as one expects from Sedos… These are alternately funny and disturbing vignettes, excellently played by a confident and talented cast.

>…there are no weak performances… the show is definitely worth seeing. Director Jacqui Adams has produced a show that will linger in people’s minds, and one [that] again confirms Sedos’ status as a company known for putting on provocative drama.

## *Godspell*

>This is quite simply the best amateur production I have ever seen… Any director worth their salt would be proud of what Stanex and choreographer Kimberley Barker have achieved… It goes without saying that the role of Jesus is crucial and Joe Penny, a researcher at the New Economics Foundation in his day job, is astounding. Many a West End performer should count themselves lucky that they are not up against this immensely talented young man when auditioning for professional shows… as an ensemble [the supporting cast] are faultless…

>Pulses with unflagging energy… The ensemble work in this show is outstanding. The cast takes ownership of the whole playing area and often the auditorium as well as the side entrances… The slickly professional movement work is a great credit to choreographer Kimberly Barker and really shows how a company of the calibre of Sedos can seriously blur the difference between professional and amateur work.

## *Gormenghast*

>These are seriously good actors, working hard to make the play work in a style that is always in danger of disappearing up its own backside, as plenty of similar productions have done since this style of theatre appeared half a century ago (or should I say ‘reappeared’, since the similarities with classical Greek tragedy are striking). The fact that it didn’t fail is testament to the talent of the actors and the cojones of director Andrew Marchant… I don’t think Sedos intended to give its audience an easy ride, pushing theatre as far as they could. This style of theatre isn’t for everyone, but, taken purely on its own terms, Gormenghast was an unquestioned success.
