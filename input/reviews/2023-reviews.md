^^^ Titanic

>A triumph. Somehow, Directors Louise Roberts and Rob Archibald have managed to move their 33 strong cast around this small space with great stagecraft and not a little ingenuity, making good use of an entrance created from an opening in the seating block… There are no weak performances here… It is a privilege to hear this score sung and played so well, and to see the piece produced so impressively in a small space. Highly recommended.

>With a sprawling cast of over 30, crafting individual characters that strongly resonate is no easy feat. Yet, the talented ensemble manages the extraordinary, making you care deeply about characters, regardless of their social class and time spent on stage. The cast’s singing skills are absolutely astounding, mastering intricate harmonies and lightning-fast lyrics that elevate the musical score to remarkable heights… The talent on display is nothing short of insane… “Titanic: The Musical” is well-deservedly almost sold out for this run, but if you manage to book one of the tickets still left, there’s a possibility this may just become your new favourite musical. Don’t tell me I didn’t warn you!

>So rarely seen in amateur productions, every member of this company is a skilled vocalist, with some performances that would not be out of place on a professional West End stage (and no, I do not say that lightly). What is most impressive is the rousing ensemble numbers – never missing a harmony, Ryan Macaulay’s musical direction brings out the very best in this talented troupe, actors and band alike.

>It was a pleasure to revisit this exquisite piece of theatre, reimagined for a smaller space. It’s a familiar musical (at least to me) of a familiar story, but its emotional impact remains undimmed.

>Sedos have succeeded in taking the epic piece of history and transforming it into a moving and often personal piece of theatre whilst maintaining the impressive ensemble sound and feel to the show.

>Having seen Titanic The Musical several times before, I was keen to see how Sedos’ would create this production on a small stage and with a more modest budget than the current tour. But create and deliver they did. Congratulations to the entire company on an excellent production, both onstage and backstage, on producing a moving, stunning show of a legend.

^^^ Sondheim on Sondheim

>It was a pleasure to return to the Bridewell Theatre with a friend to enjoy their current production of Sondheim on Sondheim… The band were excellent, they sounded so good… The minimalist set with use of a split level stage and multiple entrances all contributed to smooth transitions between numbers… Lighting was effective and worked very well – there were many lighting cues which must have been very hard work for the technical crew…This was a 15 strong cast, and they all had ample opportunity to shine, both in ensemble and individually. There were no weak links in the cast…This was a high quality production with a strong ensemble cast who blended very well.

> It was wonderful to hear songs sung in harmony that are normally sung as solos and it was this area in particular that Sedos excelled at. The moments when the entire cast were on stage, singing in harmony, were my highlights of the night. The MD, Adrian Hau must be commended on the hard work that must have gone into getting such a glorious sound from the cast… Whilst talking about Adrian Hau I must also commend the band. Playing Sondheim is no easy task but this 8 piece band managed to make it sound seamless. Combined with a great sound design by Adam Coppard which ensured that the band and vocals were well balanced and the harmonies blended it was a professional sounding show… The show was directed by Tess Robinson and she ensured that the production was exceedingly slick… The set was simple but well utilised… The cast was made up of 15 very strong performers resulting in the aforementioned wonderful choral singing however there were also some moments where the soloists got a chance to shine.

^^^ Sunshine on Leith

>Sedos have really succeeded in getting across the theme of community in Sunshine on Leith, with rich harmonies and strong performances, this is a great chance to see this underperformed show.

>As we’ve come to expect from Sedos, the show is slickly and imaginatively staged

## *The Effect*

^^^ The Effect

>This production of The Effect is a definition of an intelligent, emotionally invested drama sprinkled with plenty of laughs and deep reflection on the human mind and depression. As a whole, it achieves the difficult task to keep the complex general output on an emotionally balanced level… The Effect creates a deeply moving experience for its audience.

>Within reviews there are often small moments in the show, ranging from the book, the performances or the technical side of things that I try to provide some sort of constructive criticism on where appropriate. However in Sedos’ production of The Effect there are no areas of the show that I could legitimately suggest an improvement on, a unusual thing in professional work, let alone amateur theatre. The Effect is a rare treat where the book, the performance and the technical elements merge together perfectly to create an outstanding night at the theatre.

>As you take your seat forget the word “amateur”. It has no place here. A small cast of five take on the full weight of this powerful play and its complex topics giving us a presentation as good as any professional theatre.

>We have an excellent story, so the big question is, did Sedos deliver it? The answer is a spectacular yes, they did in every way possible. From Andrew Laidlaw’s very clinical set to Natalie Harding-Cooper’s costumes, Rhona Sampson’s lighting, and Jonathan Harding-Cooper’s direction, the company broke the story down to its constituent parts and gave the audience a perfect visual setting to enjoy the words which were delivered by an outstanding cast.
