## *Road*

>I thought the staging was excellent.... There are some really powerful vignettes. Cartwright’s language is beautiful and moving at times as well as very funny at others; in particular, there are several poetic monologues which were the real highlights of the evening. Skinlad played by the excellent Darren Hannant, gives a visceral and genuinely scary account of his transition from violent skinhead to desperate Buddhist.... excellent Matt Matravers...excellent performances from the Sedos cast.
