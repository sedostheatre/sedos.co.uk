^^^ Assassins

>Dan Edge is the director of Sedos’ production and his concept was brilliantly considered… Each moment is played out perfectly in this new setting and… the ending is the icing on the cake… I am a big fan of shows being reinvented in new and relevant ways for a modern audience and Sedos has given us an exemplary display of how it should be done

>Sedos’ Assassins is a polished, provocative production that deserves a life beyond its short run. It’s daring, darkly funny, and uncomfortably timely. Sondheim’s biting score and sharp lyrics are brought to life by a cast of remarkable vocal talent. If any fringe production has earned a shot at the West End spotlight, it’s this one. Bravo indeed!

>I would strongly recommend following Sedos as quite possibly London’s finest amateur theatre company. Well done to the creative team behind the show for putting on a brilliant performance

>Assassins has never been more relevant. This may be an amateur production, but Sedos know their Sondheim and have pulled out all the stops

>When Sedos do Sondheim, you know it’s going to be special, and this energetic production of Assassins hits the mark with style… Dan Edge’s skilful direction creates a fantastic, heightened energy dynamic for this glorious parody of desperation and political violence, and Adrian Jeakins production design is wonderfully brash… Another triumph for the talented team at Sedos

^^^ The Crucible

>Overall, Sedos have delivered an intense, spirited and moving production of The Crucible. In their programme notes, joint directors Anoushka Nairac and Jonah McLeod assert The Crucible is one of the greatest works of modern drama – we want to do it justice. They have.

>Thanks to a clear portrayal of the text and some of the finest acting I have seen on an amateur stage Sedos have succeeded in showing that whilst The Crucible may be set in the past it is very much a play for the present.

# *Hedda Gabler*

^^^ Hedda Gabler

>Sedos’ production of Hedda Gabler is a riveting take on this seminal piece of theatre and one where the titular characters portrayal was nuanced and unrelenting. A darkly disturbing night at the theatre which felt fresh despite its literary heritage.
><footer><cite><a target="_blank" href="https://musicaltheatremusings.co.uk/hedda-gabler-sedos">Hedda Gabler, 2025, Musical Theatre Musings</a></cite></footer>

>This production is a striking, well-paced, and thought-provoking take on Hedda Gabler, breathing fresh life into a complex classic. It’s a reminder that while times may change, the human psyche and its capacity for destruction remain eerily constant. A thoroughly enjoyable and unsettling evening of theatre.

^^^ Hairspray

>Sedos’ production Hairspray gives you everything you could want in a show, bursting with heart, songs you come away singing and a cast that embody their characters brilliantly. You certainty can’t stop the beat with this show…..and why would I want to try!
><footer><cite><a target="_blank" href="https://musicaltheatremusings.co.uk/hairspray-sedos">Hairspray, 2025, Musical Theatre Musings</a></cite></footer>

>A highly expressive and lively production. You know an amateur dramatics society is doing something right when it puts on something more enjoyable than some of the shows on West End stages at the moment.

^^^ Violet

>Sedos have once again succeeded in putting on a touching show with exceptional acting across the board and one that deals with important themes sensitively. This was a wonderful chance to see a relatively unknown musical in an intimate venue which is perfect for this show and yet another shining example of how wonderful amateur theatre can be when done right!
