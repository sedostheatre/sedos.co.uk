              <p class="style87" style="margin-top: 0;">Don&rsquo;t take our word for how good Sedos productions are, check out some of the things the press has said about our productions.</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><br />
                &ldquo;As is the custom with Sedos productions the cast, whether in a small or large part, are all first rate and work so well together whether singing, dancing &ndash; choreography by Kim Barker &ndash; or moving Andrew Laidlaw&rsquo;s wonderfully versatile set around. Given the commitment of everyone involved, it must be great being a director at Sedos and Yojiro Ichikawa has got a fantastic cast, great set and excellent lighting by Olly Levett all working together seamlessly to bring <em>Urinetown: The Musical</em> to life&hellip; Get a ticket, take a seat and sit back for the happiest couple of hours you are likely to have this side of the festive period.&rdquo; <br />
                <em>Urinetown</em>, 2018, London Theatre 1 (*****)<br />

                <br />
                &ldquo;Sedos&rsquo; new production of<em> Urinetown</em> is yet another example of why they should be considered one of the best amateur companies in London, if not the country&hellip; I feel as though this review is slightly too glowing but honestly, it&rsquo;s a struggle to find fault. For a show that charges under &pound;20 per ticket, this is a superb night out with plenty of bang for your buck.&rdquo; <br />
                Urinetown, 2018, The 730 Review (*****)<br />
                https://www.the730review.co.uk/2018/11/22/urinetown-sedos/<br />
                <br />
                &ldquo;Sedos have created a fantastic production, very cleverly staged in the round and with minimal set which allows for a very fluid production that keeps incredible pace throughout. The direction by Yojiro Ichikawa was fantastic, getting the most out of his cast and theatre, using every possible entrance to make sure the audience is pulled into the show&hellip; The Musical Direction by Ryan Macaulay was equally as impressive, with a great sound being produced by the band alongside flawless harmonies from the cast. The powerhouse of voices created a purely superb resonance with apparent ease; a delight to the ears of the audience.&rdquo; <br />

                &ldquo;<em>Dogfight </em>is a charming yet gritty show about many shades of the human experience, from jubilant banter with friends, to romantic rejection, to the harsh reality of war.&rdquo;<br />

              &ldquo;Sedos are to be commended for giving us the chance to see such a good production of<em> Dogfight </em>The Musical. Catch it if you can!&rdquo;<br />

              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 45 years since I saw <em>Pippin</em> in the West End, and while the themes are certainly still current, the style and the devices can feel a little dated. Chris Adams&rsquo; compelling production, especially at the end, cuts through the tricks and the whimsy to achieve a genuinely moving piece of drama.&rdquo; <em>Pippin</em>, 2018, Remote Goat<br />

              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;If ever a show was crying out for a large scale return to the West End, then<em> Pippin</em> is the one and, my advice is to all the members of Sedos, give up the day jobs and take it there.&rdquo;<br />
                <span style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><em>Pippin</em>, 2018</span>, London Theatre 1 (*****)<br />

              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;For my money the show is good enough to transfer West, half a mile up the road. Certainly, many of the cast could have a second string to their bows in the commercial theatre any time they wanted.&rdquo; <br />

              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;The whole production is more polished and entertaining than many professional shows&hellip; In the hands of Sedos,<em> Pippin</em> is a gem of a musical.&rdquo;<br />

              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of productions from Sedos now and each one of them has really impressed me with the quality of the performances and attention to detail in the staging, and with<em> You Can&rsquo;t Take it With You</em>, they have delivered another first-rate production.&rdquo; <br />
                <em>You Can&rsquo;t Take it With You</em>, 2018, lastminutetheatretickets.com<br />
              https://www.lastminutetheatretickets.com/londonwestend/review-you-cant-take-it-with-you-bridewell-theatre/</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Sedos has never been, and never will be, just another &lsquo;amateur&rsquo; company! Their work stands out dramatically in so many ways. They achieve the highest possible standards on stage whilst nurturing the skills of their very talented team of players, directors, set and costume designers.&rdquo; <em>You Can&rsquo;t Take it With You</em>, 2018, Infobarrel<br />
              http://www.infobarrel.com/You_Cant_Take_it_With_You_-_A_Sedos_Production</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Another outstanding performance! As in all comedies timing and teamwork are the vital ingredients and Sedos are experts at timing. They successfully maintain their American accents throughout and their attention to detail, particularly to costumes and set design, is excellent.&rdquo; You Can&rsquo;t Take it With You, 2018, Infobarrel<br />
              http://www.infobarrel.com/You_Cant_Take_it_With_You_-_A_Sedos_Production</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What a pleasurable and delightful play this is. I could go on at length about certain aspects in this production of <em>You Can&rsquo;t Take It With You</em> that don&rsquo;t make a lot of sense, but rather like The Addams Family, the eccentricities are what make the characters in this bizarre and chaotic &ndash; but nonetheless hilarious- so compelling and unique.&rdquo; <br />
                <em>You Can&rsquo;t Take it With You</em>, 2018, Londontheatre1<br />

              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It is unfortunate that for too many people, the epithet &ldquo;amateur&rdquo; in relation to theatre remains redolent of inexpert performance in draughty church halls by well-meaning performers of limited talent. The reality is that for many groups nowadays, there is an almost invisible line between so called professional performance (ironically not necessarily of the highest quality) and other productions which are only amateur in the sense that participants have not been paid. Sedos specifically states in its programme notes that they &ldquo;strive for professional standards in both performance and production values&rdquo; and it is fair to say that they have a well-established reputation in achieving that ambition which has once again been reinforced by this production of <em>Earthquakes in London.</em>&rdquo; <br />
                <em>Earthquakes in London</em>, 2018, Musical Theatre Musings<br />
              http://musicaltheatremusings.co.uk/earthquakes-in-london</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;All told, this is another great production from Sedos that makes you stop and think about what we are doing to the earth and if we shouldn&rsquo;t be trying something different so that by the year 2525, man will still be alive.&rdquo; <br />
                <em>Earthquakes in London</em>, 2018, Londontheatre1<br />
              https://www.londontheatre1.com/reviews/earthquakes-in-london-at-the-bridewell-theatre-review/</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;The absolute bravery, or maybe insanity, of director Chris Davis to stage this play in an amateur production makes it all the more incredible. And that mention of amateur is the only time it should be raised, because believe me, there is absolutely nothing amateur about this production.&rdquo; <em>Earthquakes in London</em>, 2018, Everything Theatre<br />
              http://everything-theatre.co.uk/2018/07/earthquakes-in-london-bridewell-theatre-review.html</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Huge congratulations must go to the whole production team for putting on a fabulous show. This show is a MUST to see and would recommend to anyone.&rdquo; <br />

              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;This show was directed with &ldquo;big show values&rdquo; &ndash; it had colour, glamour, a powerful orchestra, very clever set design and beautifully contrasting performances.&rdquo; <br />
                <em>Lucky Stiff, </em>2018, Sardines (****)<br />

              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&quot;Strong production of modern classic.&quot; <br />

              https://www.remotegoat.com/uk/review/14089/strong-production-of-modern-classic/</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I think this production of <em>Our Country&rsquo;s Good </em>is the best non-professional 'straight' play (musicals are a different animal) I have ever seen. Of course that&rsquo;s partly down to the strength of Wertenbaker&rsquo;s timeless, topical, funny, poignant, horrifying text. But it&rsquo;s also a huge credit to the talented Sedos cast and their director, Chloe Robertson.&rdquo; <br />
                <em>Our Country&rsquo;s Good</em>, 2018, Sardines<br />
              http://www.sardinesmagazine.co.uk/reviews/review.php?REVIEW-Sedos-Our+Countrys+Good&amp;reviewsID=3362</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to forget that Sedos are an amateur company &ndash; their production values and talented casts are always of such a high standard. Sedos&rsquo;s production of <em>Our Country&rsquo;s Good</em>, 30 years on from it&rsquo;s Royal Court premiere, is another stunning success.&rdquo; <br />
                <em>Our Country&rsquo;s Good,</em> 2018, Fairy Powered Productions<br />
              http://fairypoweredproductions.com/our-countrys-good-review-3/?fbclid=IwAR21VRGOfvlcyQ5Aq7qHEEFm3KIJyrBUDoIn7rcO6NHpvFJVbR127yyA6jw</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;This is a brilliant, brilliant show that has always deserved to be seen. In the case of this production, more so than ever.&rdquo; <br />
                <em>The Drowsy Chaperone</em>, 2017, Sardines<br />
              http://www.sardinesmagazine.co.uk/reviews/review.php?REVIEW-Sedos-The%20Drowsy%20Chaperone&amp;reviewsID=2838</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;<em>The Drowsy Chaperone </em>may be categorised as an amateur level production, but it didn&rsquo;t show. The quality of this production was fantastic and truly entertaining.&rdquo; <br />
                <em>The Drowsy Chaperone</em>, 2017, London Theatre 1<br />
              https://www.londontheatre1.com/reviews/review-the-drowsy-chaperone-bridewell-theatre/</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I feel as if I am constantly saying this about Sedos, but they really have got amateur theatre right and <em>The Drowsy Chaperone</em> is yet another example of this.&rdquo; <br />
                <em>The Drowsy Chaperone</em>, 2017, Musical Theatre Musings</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;The beautiful set design for Sedos&rsquo; production, the sheer talent of those playing the March sisters and the clever direction means that I took this award.&rdquo;<br /> 
                <em>Little Women The Musical</em>, 2017, Musical Theatre Musings (best amateur production of 2017)<br />
              http://musicaltheatremusings.co.uk/2017-roundup</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;On realising that I was going to watch an amateur production I embarrassingly didn&rsquo;t have high hopes for this production of L<em>ittle Women the Musical</em> &ndash; however, within the first few lines, I was proven very wrong. The Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society &ndash; better known as Sedos &ndash; are an amateur company who I now realise deliver professional standard productions.&rdquo;<br />

              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Watching [Jonathon] Cooper&rsquo;s character progression and journey throughout the whole show was, I felt, a master class in acting.&rdquo; <br />

              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;A quick exit-poll on the audience provided comments such as 'exuberant', 'brilliant', 'didn't want it to end' and 'you'll regret not seeing it.' My favourite has to be 'very pink and gay, but the best kind of gay.' Congratulations to Director / Costume Designer Angus Jacobs, Musical Director Ryan Macaulay and the whole creative team. It might not be as glittery or explosive as a big-budget West End version but it's just as fabulous.&rdquo; <br />

              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Overall, then I guess it&rsquo;s pretty obvious I enjoyed Priscilla Queen of the Desert.

                &ldquo;I have seen quite a lot of Sedos productions over the last few years, and their shows are of a consistent excellent quality. They are undoubtedly a collection of extremely talented directors, actors and performers. <em>One Man, Two Guv&rsquo;nors</em> upheld that high expectation and did not disappoint; the show was of professional standard with even the smallest parts giving consistent high quality performances.&rdquo; <br />

                &ldquo;Sedos is an amateur dramatic company, but the acting is easily on par with the professional show I saw previously. In fact, having seen Sedos in action before, it seems they are once again blurring the lines between professional and amateur theatre. In particular, they prove that the quality of a show is determined by those involved &ndash; and not whether anyone is getting paid.&rdquo; <br />

While this can be true, it is easy to forget that theatre is a visual medium, and so such elements are a legitimate part of the spectacle. In the case of Sedos&rsquo; Steampunk inspired <em>Macbeth</em>, at the Bridewell Theatre, the production values are far beyond anything else you are likely to see on the fringe stage. Indeed, they put large parts of the West End to shame&hellip;Director Chloe Faine and Matt Gould (who produced the show) should congratulate themselves on a job well done, along with the rest of the cast and crew.&rdquo;<br />

<p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Within thirty seconds it was very obvious that this is no ordinary amateur company. The Sedos production of <em>Spring Awakening</em> was executed in atotally professional manner leaving little doubt that amateur theatre can be every bit as good as professional theatre, and in this case, even better.&rdquo; <br />

  <br />
  &ldquo;If this high standard can be achieved from evening rehearsals from a cast of enthusiasts then I think producers and actors across the profession may need to pull their socks up and take note.&rdquo;<br />

  <br />
  &ldquo;The entire cast were completely and utterly mesmerising; lively, engaging and full of energy. Every single cast member gave a strong all-round performance, but it was the singing that really made this a night to remember, the harmonies absolutely gave me chills&hellip; this production of S<em>pring Awakening </em>is smart, sexy and seriously packs a punch. Don&rsquo;t miss it.&rdquo; <br />

  <br />
  &ldquo;[<em>Spring Awakening</em> is] performed by Sedos, a well-established amateur company who strive to produce theatre which can stand shoulder to shoulder with professional productions. In that,<em> Spring Awakening </em>succeeds admirably.&rdquo; <br />

  <br />
  &ldquo;Chris Warner (director) and Max Wolf (creative director) should be justifiably proud of this production. They have chosen not to carbon copy the original production but instead create their own vision and that is to be applauded&hellip; on the night I attended, mature adults were visibly moved to tears.&rdquo; <br />

<p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&quot;There is little evidence of Sedos theatre company's amateur status in its charming production which neatly balances the characters' loneliness and frustration with a sense of hope and humour.&quot;<br />

<p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&quot;As the first show of 2012 for Sedos, Three Sisters rewards before it begins, by presenting the audience with a stunning set... the scale of the thing was impressive... The use of the depth of the stage at the Bridewell was a brilliant and brave move on the director's part, giving opportunity to place the actors as a framed piece of art.&quot;<br />
                <em><a href="../2012/threesisters.htm"><strong>Three Sisters</strong></a>, 2012, Remote Goat</em></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;[Sedos] should be credited as one of the premier [amateur] companies in the country, as their track record for staging professional-standard shows proves&hellip; it was a genius stroke by co-directors Roger Harwood and Dawn Harrison-Wallace to stage the entire show as a flashback&hellip; the casting was difficult to fault&hellip; [the cast] all did a great job of bringing the show to life&hellip; top marks must go to the costume team for their fantastic work&hellip; [musical director] David Griffiths and his musicians gave a performance grander than many of those you'd hear in West End theatres&hellip; Congratulations again to Sedos for another great production&hellip;&rdquo;<br />

              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Billed as an amateur production, the Sedos&rsquo; cast are anything but.

              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;The amateur production I refer to was the very professionally staged version by Sedos&hellip; As dry and as sterile as this group may sound (bankers, dancing?), the talent involved was phenomenal&hellip; The cast, for one, was perfectly formed&hellip; everyone did a fantastic job, all the more incredible when you realise that this was an amateur production&hellip;&rdquo; <br />

A wonderful set of costumes are atmospherically lit by fiercely stark beams and the band is simply superb.&rdquo;</span><br />

              <p class="style40" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;A riveting production... Musical Director Matthew Gould has obviously worked a great deal with an already very gifted cast, and it has paid off. From Richard Ash&rsquo;s opening lines to the last note of the piece, Parade is beautifully and emotionally sung... The second act&rsquo;s &lsquo;All the Wasted Time&rsquo; is breathtakingly good, and if there was no other merit to this production, it would be worth seeing for these few brilliant minutes alone.&rdquo;<br />
