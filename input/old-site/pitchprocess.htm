              INTRODUCTION</span></strong></span><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial;font-size:13px;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:16px;"><strong><span style="font-family:arial;font-size:13px;">With a membership of over 200, a  programme of around eight to 10 challenging productions every year and a  reputation for professional quality in every production, Sedos is proud of our  claim to be the premier amateur theatre group in the City of London. We are now  seeking proposals for our 2015 season.</span></strong><span style="font-family:arial;font-size:13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial;font-size:13px;">Sedos presents a  variety of shows &mdash; from classic plays such as Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Macbeth</em>, to modern musicals such as <em>Spring Awakening.</em> We prefer to present  modern classics or interesting takes on more traditional works. For example in  recent years we have performed a fair amount of Stephen Sondheim musicals (eg <em>Into the Woods, A Little Night Music</em>)  and Donmar Warehouse and Royal Court inspired plays (eg <em>Enron, The Last Days of Judas Iscariot</em>). We also love a challenge &mdash;  and performing shows that are unusual or may be considered technically  difficult &mdash; eg Alan Ayckbourn&rsquo;s two simultaneous plays <em>House/Garden</em> or rarer classics such as Maltby and Shire&rsquo;s <em>Baby</em>. Eclecticism and interest is what  is going to inspire the committee! What we aspire to is challenging, excellent  theatre.</span></span></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial;font-size:13px;">For more information  about Sedos and our previous shows, please visit the <a href="archive/index.htm"><strong>Sedos Archive</strong></a></span></span></span></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;">For more information about Sedos and our previous shows, please vis archive should give you a pretty good idea about the types of shows that we tend to favour &mdash; but we are always looking for new and challenging ideas!<br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:16px;"><strong><span style="font-family:arial; font-size:15px;">RESIDENT AT THE BRIDEWELL THEATRE</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;">We are the resident  theatre company at the Bridewell Theatre and we perform there for 10 weeks a  year. This is generally split into three or four plays and a similar number of  musicals.&nbsp; Plays are generally performed  for a week. Musicals tend to range from the better known which we perform for  two weeks to the less well known that we perform for a week.&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong><span style="font-family:arial; font-size:15px;">EDINBURGH / &ldquo;IN THE CITY&rdquo; / SUMMER FESTIVAL / OTHER IDEAS</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">In addition to our  performances at the Bridewell Theatre, we often take a show to the Edinburgh  Fringe; and perform another show as a touring &ldquo;In the City&rdquo; production. If we  do support an Edinburgh show, we may want to combine it with performances in  London &mdash; probably during the summer three-week slot, but we may consider  putting London performances on at a different venue.</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">We have a three-week slot  in the summer. This is the third year of holding a Summer Festival. We are not  wedded to this idea and if people have other suggestions as to how to use this  slot, we would welcome that &mdash; for example a &ldquo;big&rdquo; show that would require  additional get-in time, or a pair of related shows.&nbsp; Or even a mini-season &mdash; we would love to hear  suggestions as to how to use this.</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">We also like to  perform cabarets and devised shows. We produced the successful <em>Eurosedos</em> for a few years, which is  being revived this year, as well as the well received devised cabarets <em>Too Darn Hot</em> and <em>Red Hot and Black</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong><span style="font-family:arial; font-size:15px;">NEW TEAMS / ENCOURAGING NEW PEOPLE TO DIRECT</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">We encourage new  people to pitch for shows. It is true, however, that we do tend to favour those  who have been involved with the society in other ways before giving them a show  &mdash; this is because we find that the best way of being able to assess whether we  think that someone is going to be &ldquo;right&rdquo; for Sedos, is knowing them already!  We therefore encourage people who are thinking of pitching to get involved with  the society first &mdash; for example by assistant directing, producing, acting,  stage managing etc. That being said, there are no hard and fast rules, and we  have been known to award a show to someone who has not previously been involved  with a Sedos production. If you are not so well known to us, you might want to  consider pitching something to form part of the Summer season, or otherwise a  &ldquo;smaller, less risky&rdquo; title. That is also true for people involved with Sedos  already &mdash; for example actors, chroeographers etc, but who have not previously  directed. It has to be admitted that we are unlikely to entrust a two-week  musical to an untried director &mdash; unless of course they are an established  member of the society with a strong team around them.</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">We will accept  pitches from anyone &mdash; including choreographers and producers &mdash; and will assist  in pulling teams together if we think that there may be other suitable people  to complement the team.</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">We do not insist that  directors have a full team when they pitch, however, we have to be confident  that they will be able to pull a team together. <br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong><span style="font-family:arial; font-size:15px;">WHAT SHOW SHALL I PITCH</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Sedos is a pitch-led  society. We want to create a balanced and varied season to ensure that across  the year, we can appeal to as wide a cross-section of our membership as  possible. Whilst breaking even is important, we are not seeking just to put on  &ldquo;money-makers&rdquo;/&rdquo;blockbusters&rdquo; for their own sake. We also prefer shows that we  believe work well in the Bridewell space&nbsp;  &mdash; so if a pitch appears to be for &ldquo;set-heavy&rdquo; show, we would want to  understand how the vision would work at the Bridewell. We also tend to favour  shows where we are confident that most of the cast (and certainly most of the  main principals) can be cast from our own members. While we have an  open-audition policy, we want to ensure that our membership have a reasonable  chance of being cast!</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">A number of people  have asked us for suggested &quot;titles&quot;. &nbsp;It is really for the pitchers to propose  titles they are passionate about. That said, we note the following shows have  recently been made available to&nbsp;amateurs (or will be soon):&nbsp;<em>Soho  Cinders,&nbsp;Lend Me a Tenor,&nbsp;Zorro,&nbsp;The Beautiful Game,&nbsp;Bonnie  and Clyde, Legally Blonde, The Addams Family </em>and&nbsp;<em>Candide</em>.&nbsp;[Note,  we previously mentioned that we had heard that <em>Sunset Boulevard </em>was being released to amateurs &ndash; whilst that is  true, we have been told that it is not currently being released to Central  London based companies.]&nbsp; Note &ndash; if you  are thinking of pitching one of these &ldquo;new&rdquo; titles, please contact us via <a href="mailto:pitches@sedos.co.uk"><strong>pitches@sedos.co.uk</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;">For inspiration, look  at the websites of the major rights holders: </p>

              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong><span style="font-family:arial;font-size:13px;">A word on rights</span></strong><span style="font-family:arial;font-size:13px;"><br />
  Often the biggest headache with putting together a season is rights  availability. Shows that we would all love to do are not currently available to  us. &nbsp;Particularly with plays, a number of  rights holders won&rsquo;t give us the rights to perform shows that are regularly on  in the West End.&nbsp; That includes most  modern American works (eg Arthur Millar, Tennessee Williams) and also a fair  amount of popular titles by the likes of Alan Bennett and Tom Stoppard.&nbsp; If you are not sure whether a title is likely  to be available, it is worth approaching the committee / rights holders to find  out. We are very happy to assist with this process.<br />
  <br />
              </span></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong><span style="font-family:arial; font-size:15px;">BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">We work to  disciplined budgets, which we balance with artistic excellence. This is a  challenge, but one that we expect all producers and teams to rise to. Template  budgets for one- and two-week musicals and a one-week play are set out at the  end of the Application Form.<br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong><span style="font-family:arial; font-size:15px;">JEREMY LEWIS LEGACY</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">You may be aware that  Sedos received a very generous bequest from a former chairman of the society,  Jeremy Lewis. The terms of Jeremy&rsquo;s bequest are to support productions or  production values that we might not otherwise be able to achieve. We are happy  to receive pitches solely based on an enhanced budget &mdash; where it would not be  feasible to achieve it on a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; budget. We are also interested in  &ldquo;regularly budgeted&rdquo; shows requesting additional funding. Note, any award of  additional legacy funding will only be made on the basis of enhancing the  audience&rsquo;s experience or doing something we might not otherwise be able to do &mdash;  not to simplify and ease the burden on a show producer! Further details are set  out in the Appendix to these guidelines. <br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong><span style="font-family:arial; font-size:15px;">PROCESS</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The whole committee  is involved in making a decision about the season choices. The committee  includes directors and non-directors and people with a musical as well as a  play background. This ensures that the choosing process is as fair as possible.  But please remember that we are also trying to put together as balanced a  season as possible, as well as trying to accommodate the availability of teams  and deal with the inevitable frustrations with rights!</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">This document is for  you to tell us all about your show, your team and other bits and bobs; feel  free to add anything you think will help us to understand your choice. We don&rsquo;t  believe everything fits in a box; so if you want to add something that doesn&rsquo;t  fit, please feel free to add more details at the end of the form. We love  receiving applications that include pictures, sample marketing materials and  generally show creative thought!<br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong><span style="font-family:arial; font-size:15px;">TIMETABLE</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The committee will be  making its selections in time to announce the full season at our EGM scheduled  for the end of September (exact date to be confirmed).</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Please make sure you  send in your completed document and any other details to <a href="mailto:pitches@sedos.co.uk"><strong>pitches@sedos.co.uk</strong></a>. </p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The closing date for  submissions is <strong>Sunday 3rd August</strong>.&nbsp; Applications received after this date may not  be considered.</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Please note, we may  ask you to come and share your vision with the committee &mdash; this is likely to be  at the start of September.<br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong><span style="font-family:arial; font-size:15px;">MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PITCHES</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Each director can  submit a maximum of <strong>three </strong>pitches  for the 2015 season and must be committed to each pitch equally.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">In addition, a  director may submit a separate pitch including a request for Jeremy Lewis  legacy monies. This could also be one of your other proposals, but  demonstrating how the additional monies could be spent, or a different  title.&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong><span style="font-family:arial; font-size:15px;">ANY QUESTIONS?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">If you have any  questions about the process, about rights, or indeed anything else, please  contact any member of the committee, or drop a note to <u><span style="color:#002060;"><a href="mailto:pitches@sedos.co.uk">pitches@sedos.co.uk</a></span></u>.</p>
              <p class="style40" style="margin-top:0;">We look forward to  hearing from you &mdash; and to receiving some fantastic, innovative and interesting  pitches from which we can derive a great season for 2015!</p>
