title: For Hire
---
As well as putting on productions, we also hire out costumes and props. 

We know how tricky sourcing everything for shows can be. All the items we hire out are those that we've accumulated over the years. We decided that offering them to other amateur groups in a similar situation to us would be putting them to best use. 

So whether it's a single prop or item of clothing, or a full set of The Full Monty final scene outfits (!), why not have a chat with us about how we might be able to help? 

Email your query to our dedicated costume and prop address, **hires@sedos.co.uk**, and we'll go from there!
