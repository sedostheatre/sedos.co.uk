***Richard III* is one of Shakespeare’s most famous history plays. It follows the machinations of Richard, Duke of Gloucester, as he attempts to clear the obstacles between himself and the throne of England in the years following the War of the Roses.**

Our production will do away with the duels and pitched battles - with grandly dressed kings, queens and nobles - and instead take us to the modern seat of power in the United Kingdom: Westminster. 

Focussing on the the wake of the Brexit Referendum and the leadership of Brois Johnson, the play's themes of ambition, betrayal, political machination, appearance versus reality and the accrual of personal power are reflected in the politics of the British Government and the Conservative Party. 

With this modern, political setting allied with ambitious technical elements, we hope to tell the old story of Richard III in a new way.
