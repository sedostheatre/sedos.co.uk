metaTitle: Richard III, by William Shakespeare, plays at the Bridewell Theatre
  from 9-18 May 2024
metaDescription: " Richard III, by William Shakespeare, is one of Shakespeare’s
  most famous history plays. It is part of Sedos’ 2024 season and plays at the
  Bridewell Theatre from 9-18 May 2024"
---
**An ambitious, manipulative, ruthless man, scheming to reach the height of power.**

This retelling of one of Shakespeare’s most popular history plays does away with duels, grandly dressed nobles and pitched battles, taking us instead to the current seat of power in the United Kingdom: Westminster. 

The green benches and corridors buzz with betrayal, deception and plots as our protagonist tries to clear the obstacles blocking his route to the ultimate prize – and then to cling desperately to his position.

Combining a modern political setting with innovative technical elements and Shakespeare’s timeless prose, this fresh production will tell the old story of Richard III in a new way, connecting with those seeing the show for the first time and delighting abiding fans.

*Richard III* includes themes of death, murder and drug use.
