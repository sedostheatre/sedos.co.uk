**Richard, Duke of Gloucester. Boris Johnson. Ambitious, manipulative, ruthless men, scheming to reach the height of power.**

This retelling of one of Shakespeare’s most popular history plays does away with duels, grandly dressed nobles and pitched battles, taking us instead to the current seat of power in the United Kingdom: Westminster. 

The green benches and corridors buzz with betrayal, deception and plots as our protagonist tries to clear the obstacles blocking his route to the ultimate prize – and then to cling desperately to his position.

Combining a modern political setting with innovative technical elements and Shakespeare’s timeless prose, this fresh production will tell the old story of Richard III in a new way, connecting with those seeing the story for the first time and delighting abiding fans.

*Richard III* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 9-18 May 2024.
