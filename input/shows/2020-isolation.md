**20 March-19 April 2020**

When physical performance spaces go dark and creatives are forced to isolate, communities, more than ever, need theatre.

The show must go on!

Over the next 30 days we invite you to join us in creating new digital theatrical content exploring the theme of isolation.

Just because you are physically distancing doesn’t mean we can’t still be social. We want you, with your housemates, to turn your home into a live performance space.

There are opportunities for writers, composers, actors, dancers, tech creatives and directors all to get involved.

The experiment will culminate in a virtual showcase on Sunday 19 April at midday.

**WRITERS & COMPOSERS**

Write a 90 second monologue, duologue or song based on the theme of isolation and send it to isolation@sedos.co.uk

The deadline is midday on 3 April 2020.

**ACTORS & DANCERS**

On 4 April we will send you a text or song.

You will then have 2 weeks to prepare and film your piece.

To register please email isolation@sedos.co.uk and let us know whether you would like a monologue, duologue or song to create.

The deadline to receive finished content is midday on 17 April 2020.

**TECH CREATIVES**

Can you support in ensuring our digital theatrical content has a high production value?

If you can offer remote support in design, lighting, sound or editing, let us know and we’ll put you in touch.

**DIRECTORS**

Can you offer some remote guidance to those producing content? Get in touch and we will link you up.

**AUDIENCE**

Keep an eye on our social media from **midday on Sunday 19 April** to see the results.

To register your interest or for more information email isolation@sedos.co.uk
