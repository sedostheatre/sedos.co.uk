> How many of us would be willing to settle when we're young for what we eventually get? All those plans we make...what happens to them? It's only a handful of the lucky ones that can look back and say that they even came close.

Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman's biting comedy celebrates non-conformity and has been delighting audiences since 1936.

You Can't Take it With You introduces audiences to the freethinking Sycamore family and the mayhem that ensues when their daughter's fiancé brings his conservative, straight-laced parents to dinner on the wrong night.

The play won the 1937 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and was adapted for the screen, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director. The show was revived on Broadway in 2014 starring James Earl Jones and Rose Byrne.
