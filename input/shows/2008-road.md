      >I thought the staging was excellent.... There are some really powerful
      vignettes. Cartwright’s language is beautiful and moving at times as well
      as very funny at others; in particular, there are several poetic
      monologues which were the real highlights of the evening. Skinlad played
      by the excellent Darren Hannant, gives a visceral and genuinely scary
      account of his transition from violent skinhead to desperate Buddhist....
      excellent Matt Matravers...excellent performances from the Sedos cast.

**Voted “36th best play of the 20th century” in a poll by the National Theatre, Jim Cartwright’s *Road* weaves a path through the lives of ordinary working class Lancastrians enduring the dark days of Thatcherism.**

As darkly comic as they are desperate, Scullery, local stud-about-town, and his fellow inhabitants of the *Road* drink, fight and fornicate their way through a wild Saturday night, taking us on journeys that are by turns achingly poignant and gleefully satirical.
