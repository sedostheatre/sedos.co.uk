      >The beautiful set design for Sedos’ production, the sheer talent of those
      playing the March sisters and the clever direction means that I took this
      award.

      > On realising that I was going to watch an amateur production I embarrassingly didn’t have high hopes for this production of Little Women the Musical – however, within the first few lines, I was proven very wrong. The Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society – better known as Sedos – are an amateur company who I now realise deliver professional standard productions.

**Against the backdrop of Civil War, aspiring writer Jo hides from life’s difficulties in her attic and pens stories of adventure.**

With her father away, Jo and her sisters must learn to negotiate love, loss and life under the ever-loving watch of their beloved Marmee.

But despite tragedy and heartbreak, the March sisters discover that in reality the true adventure is life itself.

This much-loved musical adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel is suitable for all the family and reminds us that sometimes when you dream, your dreams come true.
