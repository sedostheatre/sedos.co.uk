      >The beautiful set design for Sedos’ production, the sheer talent of those
      playing the March sisters and the clever direction means that I took this
      award.

      > On realising that I was going to watch an amateur production I embarrassingly didn’t have high hopes for this production of Little Women the Musical – however, within the first few lines, I was proven very wrong. The Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society – better known as Sedos – are an amateur company who I now realise deliver professional standard productions.

> Some books are so familiar that reading them is like being home again.

Against the backdrop of Civil War, aspiring writer Jo hides from life’s difficulties in her attic and pens stories of adventure.

With her father away, Jo and her sisters must learn to negotiate love, loss and life under the ever-loving watch of their beloved Marmee.

But despite tragedy and heartbreak, the March sisters discover that in reality the true adventure is life itself.

This much-loved musical adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel is suitable for all the family and reminds us that sometimes when you dream, your dreams come true.
