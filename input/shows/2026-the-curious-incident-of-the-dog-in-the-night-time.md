**“My name is Christopher John Francis Boone… I know all the countries of the world and capital cities. And every prime number up to 7,507.”**

The neighbours’ dog shows up dead in their front garden. Fifteen-year-old Christopher Boone is determined to find out what happened through logical detective-work. But Christopher’s investigation uncovers more than he bargains for and leads him onto a journey outside his carefully ordered world.

“The novel gets you inside Christopher's head, but the stage version does more, giving Christopher's internal response to the world an external manifestation. That world is often a surreal and scary place, but oddly beautiful and bizarre, too: I'll never look at a Battenberg cake in the same way again.”\
*The Guardian*

Director Alice Bennett commented: "As an autistic person, *The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time* has always felt personal to me. The show is sharp, moving, and unlike any other play you’ll see on stage. We want this production to be dynamic and bring the audience into Christopher’s world through sound, lighting and movement. I’m so excited to be a part of bringing it to the Sedos stage!"

**Content warnings:** killing of an animal, death of a family member, domestic violence. Recommended for ages 10+

*The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 14-18 July 2026.

**ACCESS PERFORMANCES**

**Wednesday 15 July, 7.30pm:** open captioning. A captioned performance uses real-time captions to represent spoken dialogue and other important audio elements during the show. This allows audience members who are D/deaf or hard of hearing to follow the plot. Thank you to [Digital4](https://www.digital-4.co.uk/) for supporting this production. 

The best seats for seeing the captions are C1-7, D1-7, E1-7, F1-7 and G1-7. This area will be marked when you go to select your seats.

**Matinee on Saturday 18 July, 1pm:** open captioning, as above, plus relaxed performance. 

Changes will include: 

* A modified lighting design to reduce flashing lights
* The house lights are dimmed rather than turned off
* Loud noises will be reduced and the general volume of the music turned down
* The plot and characters will be introduced on stage before the show
* Easy-read information will be available on characters, the plot and sensory warnings, with a member of the production team in the foyer before the show to give more information
* Audience members are welcome to move around and make noise during the show. They can also leave and re-enter theatre at any time, with the bar and its overflow room available as areas to relax during the performance
