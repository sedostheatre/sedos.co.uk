**“My name is Christopher John Francis Boone… I know all the countries of the world and capital cities. And every prime number up to 7,507.”**

The neighbours’ dog shows up dead in their front garden. Fifteen-year-old Christopher Boone is determined to find out what happened through logical detective-work. But Christopher’s investigation uncovers more than he bargains for and leads him onto a journey outside his carefully ordered world.

“The novel gets you inside Christopher's head, but the stage version does more, giving Christopher's internal response to the world an external manifestation. That world is often a surreal and scary place, but oddly beautiful and bizarre, too: I'll never look at a Battenberg cake in the same way again.”\
*The Guardian*

Director Alice Bennett commented: "As an autistic person, *The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time* has always felt personal to me. The show is sharp, moving, and unlike any other play you’ll see on stage. We want this production to be dynamic and bring the audience into Christopher’s world through sound, lighting and movement. I’m so excited to be a part of bringing it to the Sedos stage!"

**Content warnings:** killing of an animal, death of a family member, domestic violence.

*The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 14-18 July 2026.
