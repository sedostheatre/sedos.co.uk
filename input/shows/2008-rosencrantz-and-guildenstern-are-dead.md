**Tom Stoppard’s most popular play makes a welcome return to the London stage as Sedos, London’s leading non professional theatre company, present *Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead* at the Bridewell Theatre this July.**

A red hot slice of existential uncertainty, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern stumble through events beyond their control, flying the flag of ‘what am I doing here’ for supporting characters everywhere. They find themselves faced with kings and queens, murder and murderers, clowns, boats, pirates, a manic depressive prince and …actors…

With a live original score and a twist in the tale of Shakespeare’s ill-fated attendant lords, Sedos unveil a fresh interpretation of this contemporary classic.

>One of the most original and engaging of post-war plays
