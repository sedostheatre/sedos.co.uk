      #### **Improv Double Bill: Simprov and The Banana Hut Gang Together**


      We’ve a double bill of comedy on Wednesday 22 September as Sedos’ two improvisation groups, Simprov and The Banana Hut Gang come together for a evening of laughter and spontaneous fun.


      Simprov is the Sedos group that lets members and non-members explore their impulsive side and learn about the art of improvisation. During their show they’ll be taking inspiration from the audience as well as showing some of the comic set-ups and games they play to come up with comedy gold .


      We also have our very own in-house improv group, The Banana Hut Gang, which was formed from a collection of the most die-hard Simprov attendees. The gang will be performing part of their Edinburgh award-winning show, *Choose Your Own... Improv*, which is guaranteed to lift your spirits!


      What do you want to see? A marriage or a funeral? An abandoned spaceship or a creepy dungeon? A murder or a resurrection? In Choose Your Own... Improv!, you decide. Join the Banana Hut Gang as they create a brave new improvised world where you get to call the shots. Keep the story on track, derail it completely, or start again... the choice is yours!

      #### THURSDAY 23 SEPTEMBER | From 7.30pm


      Whether you want to get up and sing or just relax and enjoy a drink with friends, our Everyone Welcome Sedos Social is the perfect event to bring you back to the Bridewell Theatre, which will be transformed into a relaxed, intimate venue for an evening of chat, reunion and perhaps a bit of song!


      If the mood takes you, musical maestros Ryan Macaulay and  Matt Gould will be on hand to tinkle the ivories while you entertain us with a torch song, modern belter or classic showstopper. It’s an Open Mic, so the choice is yours! We’ll have some musical scores and collections to browse through, but if you’re looking for something specific, please feel free to bring along your own music.


      Alternatively, grab a drink - you'll get a FREE Welcome drink - and catch-up with friends while listening to some great music. It’s going to be a friendly, relaxed event and the perfect opportunity to get us back together again.


      The *Everyone Welcome Sedos Social* is free to attend, but please register [on our box office](https://sedos.ticketsolve.com/shows) so we know how many people to expect!
