After staging Lucy Prebble’s sold-out *[Enron](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2013-enron)* to great acclaim, in 2023 Sedos returns to the writer 10 years on to tackle her follow up play about medicine and the mind.

Two young volunteers, Tristan and Connie, agree to take part in a clinical drug trial. Succumbing to the gravitational pull of attraction and love, however, Tristan and Connie manage to throw the trial off-course, much to the frustration of the clinicians involved. This funny, moving and perhaps surprisingly human play explores questions of sanity, neurology and the limits of medicine, alongside ideas of fate, loyalty and the inevitability of physical attraction.

This show contains references to mental illness, and sexual language and actions.

*The Effect* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 21-25 March 2023. 

This amateur production of The Effect is presented by arrangement with Concord Theatricals Ltd. on behalf of Samuel French Ltd. [www.concordtheatricals.co.uk](https://www.concordtheatricals.co.uk)

><em>The Effect</em></a> is a headlong delve into the mysteries of the human brain. And Prebble pulls it off with assurance, tickling our cerebellums in the first half, before tugging on our heartstrings in the second ... heartbreaking ... [it has] a heart as well as a brain.

The Effect team is proud and excited to be supporting CALM - the Campaign Against Living Miserably.

Some of the complex themes in The Effect surrounding mental illness and its treatment will be all too familiar to so many people. Because of that, as a team, we have decided to raise funds for CALM – a leading movement against suicide in the UK.

You can learn more about the fantastic work CALM is doing and how you can show your support [here](https://www.justgiving.com/page/the-effect2023).
