**The Effect is a clinical romance.** 

Two young volunteers, Tristan and Connie, agree to take part in a clinical drug trial. Succumbing to the gravitational pull of attraction and love, however, Tristan and Connie manage to throw the trial off-course, much to the frustration of the clinicians involved. This funny, moving and perhaps surprisingly human play explores questions of sanity, neurology and the limits of medicine, alongside ideas of fate, loyalty and the inevitability of physical attraction.

After staging Lucy Prebble's *[Enron](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2013-enron)* to great acclaim in 2023, Sedos returns to the writer ten years on to stage her follow up play about medicine and the mind.

><em>The Effect</em></a> is a headlong delve into the mysteries of the human brain. And Prebble pulls it off with assurance, tickling our cerebellums in the first half, before tugging on our heartstrings in the second ... heartbreaking ... \[it has] a heart as well as a brain.
