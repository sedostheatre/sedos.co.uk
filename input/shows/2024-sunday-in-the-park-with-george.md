**White. A blank page or canvas. The challenge: bring order to the whole.**\
**Through design. Composition. Tension. Balance. Light. And harmony.**

In 1883 immersed in his studio, eccentric artist, George, attempts to capture the characters he sees around him through pointed spots of colour, much to the bemusement of local critics.

100 years later history repeats itself when his great-grandson, George, reveals his latest work, Chromoloume #7, to mixed reviews.

Is his career finished? Or can his beloved muse, Dot, bring him to life as he did her?

Inspired by the little-known life of Georges Seurat and his pioneering painting “A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte”, *Sunday In The Park With* George explores love, loss, and what it means to sacrifice ones self for art.
