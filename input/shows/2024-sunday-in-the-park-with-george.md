**Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine’s stunning masterpiece *Sunday In The Park With George* merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art.** 

One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.

The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat’s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat’s descendant - named George and also an artist – finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.
