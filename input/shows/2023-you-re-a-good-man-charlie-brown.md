**With charm, wit and heart, *You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown* explores life through the eyes of Charlie Brown and his friends in the Peanuts gang.**

Based on the beloved Charles Schulz comic strip, Charlie Brown and the entire Peanuts bunch explore life's great questions as they play baseball, struggle with homework, sing songs, swoon over their crushes, and celebrate the joy of friendship.

Charlie Brown, who has never been able to keep a kite in the air, wonders what it takes to be a ‘good man’ as he sees Schroeder’s passion for Beethoven, Lucy’s psychiatrist booth, Linus’ complex about his blanket, Sally’s new philosophy and Snoopy’s ace flying ability. With the help of his friends, Charlie comes to realise what makes them all truly happy.

**Audition details to be announced soon.**

Based on the Comic Strip ‘Peanuts’ by Charles M. Schulz\
