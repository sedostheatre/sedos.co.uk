      “This is a brilliant, brilliant show that has always deserved to be seen.
      In the case of this production, more so than ever.”[The Drowsy Chaperone,
      2017,
      Sardines](http://www.sardinesmagazine.co.uk/reviews/review.php?REVIEW-Sedos-The%20Drowsy%20Chaperone&reviewsID=2838)


      “The Drowsy Chaperone may be categorised as an amateur level production,
      but it didn’t show. The quality of this production was fantastic and truly
      entertaining.”[The Drowsy Chaperone, 2017, London Theatre
      1](https://www.londontheatre1.com/reviews/review-the-drowsy-chaperone-bridewell-theatre/)


      “I feel as if I am constantly saying this about Sedos, but they really
      have got amateur theatre right and the Drowsy Chaperone is yet another
      example of this.”[The Drowsy Chaperone, 2017, Musical Theatre
      Musings](http://musicaltheatremusings.co.uk/drowsy-chaperone-sedos)
