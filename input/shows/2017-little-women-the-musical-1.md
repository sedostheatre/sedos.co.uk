      “This is a brilliant, brilliant show that has always deserved to be seen.
      In the case of this production, more so than ever.”[The Drowsy Chaperone,

      “The Drowsy Chaperone may be categorised as an amateur level production,
      but it didn’t show. The quality of this production was fantastic and truly
      entertaining.”[The Drowsy Chaperone, 2017, London Theatre

      “I feel as if I am constantly saying this about Sedos, but they really
      have got amateur theatre right and the Drowsy Chaperone is yet another
      example of this.”[The Drowsy Chaperone, 2017, Musical Theatre

**Winner of five Tony Awards including Best Book of Musical and Best Original Score,*The Drowsy Chaperone*bursts to life on the Bridewell Theatre stage this May.**

A Man sits at home, and looks for a cure for his “non-specific sadness”. He turns to his record collection and selects a little-known recording from the glory days of Broadway, “The Drowsy Chaperone”. As the record plays, we are transported into the world of a 1920s musical where there are gangsters, mistaken identities and a wedding that may or may not happen. While the musical comes to life around him, we not only learn more about the characters of the farcical production, but more about The Man and how he came to be sitting alone, feeling blue.

Both a riot of musical silliness, and a commentary on the transformative powers of story-telling, this short show will appeal to the theatre geek in all of us.
