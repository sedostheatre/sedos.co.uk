***The Color Purple* documents the traumas and gradual triumph of Celie, an African American teenager raised in rural isolation in Georgia. Celie narrates her life through painfully honest letters to God.** 

Based on the 1983 Pulitzer-prize-winning novel by Alice Walker, the musical was first performed on Broadway in 2005 and was nominated for 11 Tony Awards in 2006. The enthusiastically acclaimed Broadway revival, starring Cynthia Erivo, Jennifer Hudson and Danielle Brooks opened in late 2015 and ran through early 2017, winning two 2016 Tony Awards,including Best Revival of a Musical.

In 2024 the musical was made into a movie for the big screen where it has swept up many awards nominations including Danielle Brooks as Sofia for the Academy Award for Actress in a supporting role. 

The story weaves an intricate mosaic of women joined by their love for each other, the men who abuse them, and the children they care for.
