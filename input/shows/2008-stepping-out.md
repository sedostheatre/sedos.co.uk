**We are proud to announce that *Stepping Out* has now been cast! We had a wealth of talent to choose from so decisions were not easy. Nonetheless they were made, nobody fell out or hit anyone else, and we are extremely happy with what has turned out to be a good mix of existing and new performers.**

Rehearsals have now begun and the cast are putting in a lot of effort and attention to detail… even the tap is coming on ‘leaps and bounds’!

For all those unfamiliar with the show we are performing the play version, not the musical. The story follows Mavis and her class of amateur tap enthusiasts, from a few harmless tap routines, for a bit of fun, to putting on a rehearsed and glitzy show.

From the get-go we were looking to cast the show based on acting ability and characterisation and the capacity to make decisions, whilst taking on board direction. We have certainly achieved this whilst also managing to cast accomplished dancers/tappers. All in all everyone involved is jolly….. not just the thespy ‘suffer for your art!’ types!

Book now for this bright, sparkling show, the high-kick of the Sedos season.
