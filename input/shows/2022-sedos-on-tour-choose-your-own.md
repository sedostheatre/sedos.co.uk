**After a sell-out run at the 2019 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Sedos' in-house improv team, The Banana Hut Gang, are thrilled to present *Choose Your Own* for a limited, pre-Edinburgh run at the Hoopla Improv Theatre at The Miller, London Bridge.**

Rocket into space or face the haunted mansion? Say "I do!" or murder the best man? Save the world or end it?

In *Choose Your Own*, you decide! Join the Banana Hut Gang as they create a brave-new improvised world where the audience makes the big decisions.

Will you keep the story on track, derail it completely, or make us start again... the choice is yours!

Can't make it to London Bridge, but fancy a trip to Scotland? Full details about the Edinburgh run (15-27 August 2022) can be found on the [Edinburgh Fringe website](https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/choose-your-own).
