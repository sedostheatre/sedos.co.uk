      >Sedos… produced a production that not only had incredible production
      standards, but left me wondering why this gem of a show has been
      languishing for so long… Musically, the show was kept bouncing along under
      the baton of David Winters, whose 5 piece band were superb… Major kudos
      must go to Sedos for nurturing and producing what can only be called a
      stunning production. I just wish it were running for another week so I
      could go at least a few more times. Baby left me with a lump in my throat.
      It exceeded my every expectation and left me wanting more. Exceptional!!

***Baby* tells the story of three couples on a university campus as they deal with the painful, rewarding and agonizingly funny consequences of this universal experience.**

There are the college students, barely at the beginning of their adult lives; the thirty-somethings, having trouble conceiving but determined to try; and the middle aged parents, looking forward to seeing their last child graduate from college when a night of unexpected passion lands them back where they started.
