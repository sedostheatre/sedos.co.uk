**“COME, COME, WE MUST LAY ASIDE SOME OF OUR ROMANCE - A LITTLE WEALTH AND COMFORT MAY BE ENDURED AFTER ALL”**

Written in 1775,*The Rivals*is a classic comedy in the restoration style.

Wealthy, head-strong beauty Lydia Languish, wants to marry a poor man to offend her guardian Aunt and hopefully prompt a romantic elopement. Jack Absolute, himself a wealthy man, learns of this, and adopts the fake identity of Beverley, a poorly paid Ensign, in order to win her affections.

From this deception, many complications arise with hilarious consequences, not least because she has two other eager suitors in the shape of Bob Acres and Sir Lucius O’Trigger
