**Tom Stoppard at his most mischievous and playful, *Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead* is a ridiculously inventive retelling of Hamlet as told from the worm's-eye view.** 

The bewildered Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two of the minor characters in Shakespeare's play, stumble their way in and out of the action of Shakespeare’s iconic drama, increasingly finding themselves out of their depth as their version of the story unfolds.

In Tom Stoppard's best-known work, this Shakespearean Laurel and Hardy finally get a chance to take the lead role, but do so in a world where echoes of Waiting for Godot resound, where reality and illusion intermix, and where fate leads our two heroes to a tragic but inevitable end.

The National Theatre production in April 1967 made Tom Stoppard’s reputation virtually overnight. Its wit, stagecraft and verbal verve remain as exhilarating as they were then and the play has become a contemporary classic.
