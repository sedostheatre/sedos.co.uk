***When the Rain Stops Falling* is a beautiful and expansive play spanning four generations and two continents, from a claustrophobic London flat in 1959 to the windswept southern coast of Australia in 2039. All throughout 80 years of torrential rain.** 

It sees a series of interwoven stories come together, as seven people confront the mysteries of their past, revealing how patterns of betrayal, love and abandonment are passed on.

Andrew Bovell is best known for scripting the award winning film Lantana, hit play *Speaking In Tongues*, and co-writing Baz Luhrmann’s *Strictly Ballroom*.
