***When the Rain Stops Falling* is a beautiful and expansive play spanning four generations and two continents, from a claustrophobic London flat in 1959 to the windswept southern coast of Australia in 2039. All throughout 80 years of torrential rain.** 

It sees a series of interwoven stories come together, as seven people confront the mysteries of their past, revealing how patterns of betrayal, love and abandonment are passed on.

Andrew Bovell is best known for scripting the award winning film Lantana, hit play *Speaking In Tongues*, and co-writing Baz Luhrmann’s *Strictly Ballroom*.

#### **ROLES**

There are 9 roles. 

This is a play for an actor who loves the characterisation process and is ready to really sink their teeth into a role. Everyone gets their moment and there are a lot of striking scenes and monologues to enjoy.

 We are looking for a diverse, imaginative and creative cast of people who like to collaborate. We are very open-minded to interpretations of the characters and happy for you to put your own spin on them, hence leaving the descriptions quite sparse. We encourage you to come along and give it a go!

Whilst we are casting a family and people as the same person (younger / older), we will be basing the cast off of who is best for the role and not on what they look like. We feel the audience can be credited with enough intelligence to follow who is who. 

Where it says *Australian accent – please don’t be put off! We are not looking for perfection, and can support you learning one. You may be asked to do one in the recall, if you state that you can do it / are willing to give it a go on the audition form.

#### **AUDITIONS**

Open auditions will be 1 hour slots. They will be a mixture of games and scripted work. You will then be asked to perform one of the short monologues at the bottom of this page – you can select which one. You don’t need to learn it in advance, and copies will be provided on the day.

We also encourage video auditions for those who cannot make the open auditions. Please film yourself performing one of the monologues at the bottom of this page. Please submit these by 4pm on Saturday 23 October to rain@sedos.co.uk.

Recalls will be based on script work. You may be provided with a script in advance, but you will not be expected to learn it fully. You may be asked to read new scripts on the day, for which you will have preparation time. Please be prepared to potentially read for multiple characters.

#### **EQUALITY, INCLUSION & DIVERSITY**

Sedos seeks to build and sustain a membership that is reflective of the diverse communities within London. We actively encourage performers to audition for the roles which they feel best suit their skills. For this production, we have no real fixed ideas – and really are open to casting as diversely as we are able.
