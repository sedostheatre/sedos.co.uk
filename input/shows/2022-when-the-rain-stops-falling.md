A beautiful and expansive drama about family, betrayal and forgiveness, spanning four generations and two hemispheres. All throughout eighty years of torrential rain. 

*When the Rain Stops* Falling moves from the claustrophobia of a London flat in 1959 to the windswept coast of southern Australia, and into the heart of the Australian desert in 2039.

It interweaves a series of connected stories as seven people confront the mysteries of their past in order to understand their future, revealing how patterns of secrets, love and abandonment are passed on.

The award winning play received its European premiere at the Almeida Theatre, London, in May 2009. Andrew Bovell is a celebrated Australian writer, best known for S*peaking In Tongues* and Baz Baz Luhrmann’s *Strictly Ballroom*.
