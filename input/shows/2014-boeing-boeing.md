**It’s the 1960s, and swinging bachelor Bernard couldn’t be happier: a flat in Paris and three gorgeous stewardesses all engaged to him without knowing about each other. But Bernard’s perfect life gets bumpy when his friend Robert comes to stay and a new and speedier Boeing jet throws off all of his careful planning. Soon all three stewardesses are in town simultaneously, Robert is forgetting which lies to tell to whom, and catastrophe looms.**

A riotous farce that recently enjoyed hit revivals in London and New York, *Boeing Boeing* is set to land at Sedos City Airport near the Bridewell Theatre on the 28 of October and enjoy a stop-over every night until the 1 November! Don’t miss the flight!

*Boeing-Boeing* is a classic farce written by the French playwright Marc Camoletti, with a translation by Beverley Cross. In 1991, the play was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the most performed French play throughout the world.
