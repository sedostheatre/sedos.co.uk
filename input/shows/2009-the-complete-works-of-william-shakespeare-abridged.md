**Times are hard, times are tough. As a result of the credit crunch, we are all having to make tough choices. Should I have that extra espresso shot in my latte? Do I need to start eating own brand cereal for breakfast? Which Shakespeare play shall I see this week?**

Well luckily, Shakespeare in the City have answered one of those questions for you, as they bring *The Complete Works Of William Shakespeare (Abridged)* to the London Stock Exchange this October. A whirlwind tour through all 37 of Shakespeare's plays in just 90 minutes, with over 80 roles performed by 3 actors and around 15 different wigs.

The show holds the record for the longest running comedy in the West End and was devised and performed by a world famous Shakespeare Company. Based on a script, but largely improvised, the show has become one of the world's most popular shows, being performed in a variety of languages.

With only two performances at the Stock Exchange, there are only 200 tickets going on sale so we expect to sell out fast - so book now! The price of your ticket also includes a free glass of wine or beer. Yes, that's right. FREE BEER.
