      **Sedos are pleased to announce *Play in a Day 2021*, part of the July
      2021 Sedos Members’ Week.**


      We’ll be rehearsing and performing a play in a single day. This year’s show will be *DNA* by Dennis Kelly, and we will be rehearsing and performing in the Bridewell Theatre on Saturday 10 July.


      A group of teenagers commit a murder in the woods. They panic, and their attempts at a cover-up have a surprising effect on their lives. The play is a fast-paced ensemble show. All of the parts have a significant amount of stage time, and the play relies on a powerful group energy which we’ll be working on in rehearsals. The whole show is about 45 minutes with no interval.


      The show requires just a single day’s commitment from actors, so it’s the perfect way to get back on stage. Auditions are open to absolutely everyone, no matter your acting experience; those new to Sedos are especially welcome!


      **IN-PERSON AUDITIONS** | Saturday 19 June 2021, 9am-5pm\

      **SELF-TAPE AUDITIONS** | Deadline Saturday 19 June 2021\

      **REHEARSAL** | Saturday 10 July 2021, 9am-7:30pm \

      **PERFORMANCE** | 7:30pm-8:30pm, Bridewell Theatre
