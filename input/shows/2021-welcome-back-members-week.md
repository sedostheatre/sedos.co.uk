    title: ACTING GROUP
    body: >-
      ### **MONDAY 26 JULY 2021 | 7pm-9pm**


      **We’re back!!! Sedos is very excited to begin our in-person activities at the Bridewell Theatre with a chance for lots of people to get involved with the return of our Acting Group.** 


      The first event of our Welcome Back Members’ Week will be a friendly, relaxed and supportive atmosphere for people who want to act - whether they want to brush up on their skills, prepare for an audition or simply 'have a go'. All levels of ability are welcome, whether its your first time or your fiftieth time! 


      There's nothing to prepare. Bring yourself, a tea or coffee, and take a script to rehearse for an hour then we'll perform the scenes to the group at the end. 


      You can also bring your own script if you have a specific audition piece you want to try, or if you just really like the script! But please be aware we can’t guarantee all scripts will be used. 


      Scripts should be approx. 5 minutes (no longer than 8 minutes) and there will be a selection of 2-3 handers on the day to choose from (monologues are welcome too).


      The group is free for members but please sign up by emailing Helena at [membership@sedos.co.uk](mailto:membership@sedos.co.uk) stating your name so we have an idea of numbers. 


      That's it! We won't reply unless you ask us a specific question.


      Please note: numbers will be restricted to make sure we get through all the extracts in time, so please register ASAP. Participants will be allocated on a first come first serve basis.

      **TUESDAY 27, THURSDAY 29 and FRIDAY 30 JULY at 7.30pm | Improv with
      Banana Hut Gang**


      After keeping us entertained online over lockdown, the indefatigable Banana Hut Gang, Sedos' in- house improv team, are delighted to be back in-person with their ever changing improvised comedy play, *Choose Your Own... Improv!*, guaranteed to lift your spirits!


      What do you want to see? A marriage or a funeral? An abandoned spaceship or a creepy dungeon? A murder or a resurrection?


      In *Choose Your Own... Improv!*, you decide. Join the Banana Hut Gang as they create a brave new improvised world where you get to call the shots.


      Keep the story on track, derail it completely, or start again... the choice is yours!

    title: PIANO NIGHT SOCIAL
    body: >-
      **WEDNESDAY 28 JULY | From 7.30pm**


      **Whether you want to get up and sing or just relax and enjoy a drink with friends, our Piano Night is the perfect event to bring you back to the Bridewell Theatre, which will be transformed into a relaxed, intimate cabaret venue for an evening of song and Sedos reunion!**


      Join our musical maestros Michael Cannon and Wil Gaines and entertain us with a torch song, modern belter or classic showstopper. The choice is yours! We’ll have some musical scores and collections to browse through, but if you’re looking for something specific, please feel free to bring along your own music.


      Alternatively, grab a drink and catch-up with friends while listening to some great music. It’s going to be a friendly, relaxed event and the perfect opportunity to get us back together again.


      The *Piano Night Social* is free to attend, but please register on our box office so we know how many people to expect!

      **SATURDAY 31 JULY | From 7.30pm**


      **Join the fun this Members' Week as part of the cast in Dion Bouccicault's *The Corsican Brothers.* One of Queen Victoria's favourite plays, this action-packed ghost melodrama by the nineteenth century international star actor and playwright is based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas.** 


      Audience watch this exciting and highly theatrical piece free at 7.30pm on Saturday 31st July for one night only at the Bridewell Theatre. It’s free for friends and family to attend, though audiences do need to register (coming soon).


      **TAKE PART – NO AUDITION NECESSARY**

      \

      Scripts (which you do not need to learn!) will be issued online to cast members on Sunday 18 July, and there will be an online meeting and read through prior to the live rehearsal and performance day. The play runs approximately one hour. 


      The range of roles encompasses age and sex, and as with [Sedos Reads](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2020-lets-talk-about-scripts), our online performance season during lockdown, casting is completely open to all.  *The Corsican Brothers* has a large cast - we are looking for a cast of up to 16 - and everyone who expresses an interest to take part will be cast. No audition is needed to take part and roles will be allocated after the deadline to sign-up has passed.
