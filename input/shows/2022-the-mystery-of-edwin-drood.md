      >This marvellous production demonstrates beyond doubt that the depth of
      talent we have in London is astonishing. Sedos (the Stock Exchange
      Dramatic and Operatic Society, founded in 1905) have put together a show
      of West End quality. The self-confidence, versatility and sheer joy of
      performing shown by every cast member is inspiring and uplifting. With
      very limited resources they turn minuses into pluses, overcome every
      challenge with aplomb and deliver entertainment with an unmatched joie de
      vivre… It would be hard to improve on this. Catch it if you can.

      >In my eyes, Sedos is fast developing a reputation for staging shows which easily match the quality of many of the productions that the West End has to offer right now. With a phenomenal cast and perfectly executed musical numbers, it’s no mystery why I found this show so thoroughly entertaining.

metaDescription: The Mystery of Edwin Drood, part of Sedos’ 2022 London season,
  plays at the Bridewell Theatre from 22-26 March 2022. The show is a hilarious
  musical whodunnit based on Charles Dickens’ unfinished novel
---
**A hilarious musical whodunit loosely based on Charles Dickens’ famous unfinished novel.**

This wildly warm-hearted theatrical experience kicks off when the Music Hall Royale (a hilariously raucous Victorian musical troupe) “puts on” its flamboyant rendition of an unfinished Dickens mystery in The Mystery of Edwin Drood. The story itself deals with John Jasper, a Jekyll-and-Hyde choirmaster who is quite madly in love with his music student, the fair Miss Rosa Bud. Now, Miss Bud is, in turn, engaged to Jasper’s nephew, young Edwin Drood.

Our title character disappears mysteriously one stormy Christmas Eve - but has Edwin Drood been murdered? And if so, then whodunnit? YOU, the audience has the power to affect the outcome, so the show can be different at every performance!

*The Mystery of Edwin Drood* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 22-26 March 2022.
