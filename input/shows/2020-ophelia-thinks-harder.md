**"Artists, scholars, poets and princes will travel the world to see me... I shall pass into myth!"**

**A riotous reworking of Shakespeare's*Hamlet*- with serious themes, nevertheless. Featuring Ophelia, her maid, St Joan and a couple of locals -*Rosencrantz and Guildenstern*.**

The Prince is a hazard and the new King’s a puppet. Who the hell is running Denmark? Ophelia tries to please. Ophelia fails. Ophelia thinks harder.

With guerilla feminists invading the castle, failed spells from a frustrated maid, endless direction from a wily Queen and various ignored ghosts, this is not the Hamlet you know.

*Ophelia Thinks Harder*is a heightened, confused and darkly-funny world, where Shakespeare meets feminism. And this time Ophelia gets all the best lines.
