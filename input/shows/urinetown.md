Tomorrow will not stink!

Urinetown is a hilarious send-up of greed, love, revolution (and musicals!), in a time when water is worth its weight in gold.

In the not so distant future, a terrible water shortage has led to a government-enforced ban on private toilets. The citizens must use public amenities, regulated by Urine Good Company, a single malevolent company that profits by charging admission for one of humanity's most basic needs.

With a brutal police force maintaining law and order, it's not a place to get caught short! Risk it and you will be sent off to a place of no return - the infamous Urinetown. The city needs a revolution and every revolution needs a hero... however unlikely they may be.
