      >This play is charm personified, an absolutely delightful, whimsical and
      hilarious production that manages to be simplistic but also extremely
      clever. If you’ve even the vaguest fondness for musical theatre this is a
      must see, and Sedos have once again proven that they’re more than capable
      of producing professional quality theatre of the highest order.

      >Director Mark Siddall had cleverly created a 2D world to echo the origins of the musical, enhanced by a clever set design by Andrew Laidlaw and Mark Steward… The cast were unwavering in their commitment and had really understood the brief that they were not only playing children but playing children from a comic book… Overall Sedos understood the brief for this show well, embrace the inner child that we all have and let that play out on stage… the creativity and commitment from the cast and production team really helped make this a fun night discovering a show for the first time.

**With charm, wit and heart, *You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown* explores life through the eyes of Charlie Brown and his friends in the Peanuts gang.**

Based on the beloved Charles Schulz comic strip, Charlie Brown and the entire Peanuts bunch explore life's great questions as they play baseball, struggle with homework, sing songs, swoon over their crushes, and celebrate the joy of friendship.

Charlie Brown, who has never been able to keep a kite in the air, wonders what it takes to be a ‘good man’ as he sees Schroeder’s passion for Beethoven, Lucy’s psychiatrist booth, Linus’ complex about his blanket, Sally’s new philosophy and Snoopy’s ace flying ability. With the help of his friends, Charlie comes to realise what makes them all truly happy.

Based on the Comic Strip ‘Peanuts’ by Charles M. Schulz\
