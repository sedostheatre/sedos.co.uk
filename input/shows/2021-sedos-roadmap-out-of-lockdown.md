**A note from the chair of the Sedos management committee about our plans for the rest of 2021…**

Dear Sedos members and friends,

As London starts to come out of lockdown, we are starting to discuss what Sedos' activities might look like during the rest of 2021.  \
\
Our hope is that we can start in-person (non-socially distanced) activities from the end of June. Assuming so, this would allow us to start preparing for and rehearsing an autumn season. 

Our first priority has always been to reschedule the two shows (*Opelia Thinks Harder* and *Working*) that were cruelly stopped mid-flight. We have started to work with the production teams, casts and indeed the Bridewell to pencil in potential dates in the autumn. These will be announced in due course when we have greater certainty. 

We have decided to postpone the other 2021 titles that didn't go ahead into 2022 and are working with the teams and rights holders to reschedule. That will still leave a couple of free slots in 2022, so in due course (and when we have certainty) we will run a pitch process to look for shows to fill those slots.

We are also working on setting up a new show or shows to fill a two-week slot at the end of November. 

Finally, we have started to think about other in-person activities prior to the autumn season. We have lots of thoughts and will be reaching out for more in due course, again once we've got more certainty. 

Stay safe,

Matt Gould\
Chairman of the management committee
