**A showcase of the Sedos membership with a guest appearance by Sedance, our members' weekly dance class.**

This riotous evening of singing and dancing will also bring the Sedos Summer Festival 2014 to a close. The 2014 Sedos Summer Festival (1-19 July) is an exciting three-week summer season featuring the return of the *Eurosedos Song Contest*, an Australian comedy about a reneged bunch of ageing brownies, a satirical Russian comedy about political corruption, and an afternoon and evening of song and dance.

All shows are performed at our resident home, the Bridewell Theatre.
