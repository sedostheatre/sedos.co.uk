**"It's much better living it than looking at it"**

*Company* is a sharp, witty, and deeply human portrait of modern relationships, told through a kaleidoscope of vignettes that capture the joy, chaos, and heartbreak of being part of someone else’s life. Friends, lovers, exes, and almosts swirl around Bobby in a heady mix of cocktails, candour, and Sondheim’s razor-sharp score, from the blistering comedy of *Getting Married Today* to the aching vulnerability of *Being Alive*.

In this reimagining, the walls between audience and performer disappear. You’ll find yourself in the thick of it, clinking glasses, dodging dance moves, and catching every smirk, sigh, and side-eye up close.

A multiple award-winning masterpiece, *Company* remains one of musical theatre’s most incisive and entertaining dissections of human connection.

Step inside. Join the party. And maybe, just maybe, find the answer to what it means to be alive.

Director Emily Phillips commented: "*Company* is a dream show as a director who is also a musician because it blurs the line between dramatic storytelling and musical storytelling, giving the opportunity to shape every emotional beat through both staging and music. I couldn’t be more excited to work with this fantastic team to give audiences a new lens to appreciate this poignant and hilarious show through."

**Content warnings:** this show contains scenes of alcohol consumption and intoxication, smoking, sexual content and innuendo, adult language, themes of infidelity, and emotional conflict.

*Company* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 7-16 May 2026.
