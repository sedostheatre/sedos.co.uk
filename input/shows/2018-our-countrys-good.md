"From distant climes, o’er wide-spread seas we come,

Though not with much eclat or beat of drum,

True patriots all; for be it understood,

We left our country for our country’s good;

No private views disgrac’d our generous zeal,

What urg’d our travels was our country’s weal;

And none will doubt but that our emigration

Has prov’d most useful, to the British nation."



30 years on from its premiere at the Royal Court, Our Country's Good is a modern classic, exploring themes of crime, punishment and the unifying and civilising power of theatre.

Set in 1787, it tells the true story of a group of convicts transported to Australia who, faced with the appalling realities of life in a penal colony, come together to rehearse and perform a play.
