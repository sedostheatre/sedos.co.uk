      "Strong production of modern classic."[Our Country’s Good, 2018, Remote
      Goat](https://www.remotegoat.com/uk/review/14089/strong-production-of-modern-classic/)


      “I think this production of Our Country’s Good is the best
      non-professional 'straight' play (musicals are a different animal) I have
      ever seen. Of course that’s partly down to the strength of Wertenbaker’s
      timeless, topical, funny, poignant, horrifying text. But it’s also a huge
      credit to the talented Sedos cast and their director, Chloe
      Robertson.”[Our Country’s Good, 2018,
      Sardines](http://www.sardinesmagazine.co.uk/reviews/review.php?REVIEW-Sedos-Our+Countrys+Good&reviewsID=3362)


      “It’s easy to forget that Sedos are an amateur company – their production
      values and talented casts are always of such a high standard. Sedos’s
      production of Our Country’s Good, 30 years on from it’s Royal Court
      premiere, is another stunning success.”[Our Country’s Good, 2018, Fairy

***"From distant climes, o’er wide-spread seas we come, Though not with much eclat or beat of drum,
True patriots all; for be it understood,
We left our country for our country’s good;
No private views disgrac’d our generous zeal,
What urg’d our travels was our country’s weal;
And none will doubt but that our emigration
Has prov’d most useful, to the British nation."***

30 years on from its premiere at the Royal Court, *Our Country's Good* is a modern classic, exploring themes of crime, punishment and the unifying and civilising power of theatre.

Set in 1787, it tells the true story of a group of convicts transported to Australia who, faced with the appalling realities of life in a penal colony, come together to rehearse and perform a play.
