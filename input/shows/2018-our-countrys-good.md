      >Strong production of modern classic.

      >I think this production of Our Country’s Good is the best non-professional 'straight' play (musicals are a different animal) I have ever seen. Of course that’s partly down to the strength of Wertenbaker’s timeless, topical, funny, poignant, horrifying text. But it’s also a huge credit to the talented Sedos cast and their director, Chloe Robertson.

      >It’s easy to forget that Sedos are an amateur company – their production values and talented casts are always of such a high standard. Sedos’s production of Our Country’s Good, 30 years on from it’s Royal Court premiere, is another stunning success.

> From distant climes, o’er wide-spread seas we come, Though not with much eclat or beat of drum, True patriots all; for be it understood, We left our country for our country’s good;
> No private views disgrac’d our generous zeal,
> What urg’d our travels was our country’s weal;
> And none will doubt but that our emigration
> Has prov’d most useful, to the British nation.

**Thirty years on from its premiere at the Royal Court, *Our Country's Good* is a modern classic, exploring themes of crime, punishment and the unifying and civilising power of theatre.**

Set in 1787, it tells the true story of a group of convicts transported to Australia who, faced with the appalling realities of life in a penal colony, come together to rehearse and perform a play.
