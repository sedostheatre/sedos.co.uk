**After the success of [Season 1](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-masked-sedos-singer), Masked Sedos Singer is back for Season 2.**

Disguised Sedos members go head to head with outrageous outfits and extreme video edits – can you guess who is in the costume?

Our judges will plunder their Sedos knowledge to try to work out the identity of our performers and you can get involved too.

There will be two heats on Wednesday 7 and Tuesday 13 April leading up to a grand final on Tuesday 4 May.
