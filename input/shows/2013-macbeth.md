**Widely held to be the most popular and most performed of his tragedies, Macbeth is Shakespeare’s nightmarish picture of a mind and soul torn between ambition and conscience, and the collateral damage caused when ambition gains the upper hand.**

Inhabiting a world dominated in equal measure by mortal politicking and supernatural mischief, Sedos’ steampunk interpretation explores the influence of both on Macbeth and his wife’s bloody rise to power and ultimate fall from grace.
