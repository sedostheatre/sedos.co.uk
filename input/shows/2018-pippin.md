> Think about your life, Pippin.
Days are tame and nights the same.
Now think about the beauty
In one perfect flame...

Meet Pippin. Young, ambitious, full of potential and ready to change the world. But things are never that simple.

Setting out to make his mark, Pippin dabbles with the horrors of war, the lure of sex and the sordid world of politics, failing at every turn. But there is someone Pippin can rely on. Someone he can trust. Someone who can help Pippin be remembered forever… in one final, extraordinary blaze of glory.

With its infectious and unforgettable score from four-time Grammy and three-time Oscar winner Stephen Schwartz (Wicked, Godspell, Children of Eden), Pippin has delighted audiences across the world. The most recent Broadway revival swept the New York awards circuit, including winning the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical.

Join us. Perhaps you’ll find your very own corner of the sky.
