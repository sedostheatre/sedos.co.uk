      >It’s 45 years since I saw *Pippin* in the West End, and while the themes
      are certainly still current, the style and the devices can feel a little
      outdated. Chris Adams’ compelling production, especially at the end, cuts
      through the tricks and the whimsy to achieve a genuinely moving piece of
      drama.

      >If ever a show was crying out for a large scale return to the West End, then Pippin is the one and, my advice is to all the members of Sedos, give up the day jobs and take it there.

      >For my money the show is good enough to transfer West, half a mile up the road. Certainly, many of the cast could have a second string to their bows in the commercial theatre any time they wanted.

Meet Pippin. Young, ambitious, full of potential and ready to change the world. But things are never that simple.

Setting out to make his mark, Pippin dabbles with the horrors of war, the lure of sex and the sordid world of politics, failing at every turn. But there is someone Pippin can rely on. Someone he can trust. Someone who can help Pippin be remembered forever… in one final, extraordinary blaze of glory.

With its infectious and unforgettable score from four-time Grammy and three-time Oscar winner Stephen Schwartz (*Wicked*, *Godspell*, *Children of Eden*), *Pippin* has delighted audiences across the world. The most recent Broadway revival swept the New York awards circuit, including winning the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical.
