**Sedos, the city of London’s amateur theatre company, are delighted to announce the UK non-professional premiere of Jonathan Larson’s multi award-winning musical *Rent* at the Bridewell Theatre, Fleet Street this November.**\
\
Hot on the heels of the New York production’s September closure (making *Rent* the seventh longest running show in Broadway history) Jonathan Larson's revolutionary rock opera returns to London in its original format for only the third time. Inspired by Puccini’s *La Boheme*, *Rent* won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, the New York Drama Critics Circle Award, four Tony Awards and six Drama Desk Awards.

Running from 13 - 22 November 2008 at the Bridewell Theatre, London EC4, *Rent* will delight fans of the show keen to see the musical back in its original incarnation. Set in New York’s bohemian Alphabet City in the height of the AIDS crisis, *Rent* takes you on a journey of life, love and loss in a story that will make your heart simultaneously break and soar. This production takes *Rent* back to its roots; back to the tale that Jonathan Larson started to tell at that New York Theater Workshop.
