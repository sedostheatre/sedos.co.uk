**An intimate look at the Father of the Modern Musical, featuring new arrangements of his most beloved work.**

Hailed as a "revelatory revue full of wonderful moments" and a "funny, affectionate and revealing tribute to musical theatre's greatest living composer and lyricist," *Sondheim on Sondheim* is an intimate portrait of the famed songwriter in his own words... and music. Through the use of exclusive interview footage, audiences get an inside look at the personal life and artistic process of famed composer, Stephen Sondheim.

His story. His inspiration. His genius. The tapestry of creativity that characterizes Stephen Sondheim remained largely undiscussed, especially by the man himself, until the creation of *Sondheim on Sondheim*. Ranging from the beloved to the obscure, the carefully selected two-dozen songs hang from a framework of in-depth video interviews, delving into Sondheim's personal life and artistic process.

*Sondheim on Sondheim* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 4-8 July 2023.

**Gala night (Friday 7 July, entry with a ticket for this performance):** join us immediately after the curtain falls when we’ll welcome Alex Young (*Follies*, National Theatre, *Into The Woods*, Theatre Royal, *Standing at the Sky’s Edge*, National Theatre), Susannah Fellows (West end casts of: *Chicago*, *City of Angels*, *Aspects of Love*, *Nine*, *Evita*), Tim Sawers (former executive director, The Bridewell Theatre), David Lardi (Sondheim Society trustee) and Craig Glenday (chairman of Sondheim Society). You’ll hear all about Sondheim’s history with the Bridewell Theatre from those who were there as well as insights into his work. Plus video messages from even more special guests!
