  the Bridewell Theatre from 25-29 March 2025
metaDescription: Violet, by Jeanine Tesori, Brian Crawley and Brian Crawley, is
  a moving and award-winning musical. It is part of Sedos’ 2025 season and plays
  at the Bridewell Theatre from 25-29 March 2025
---
**This award-winning musical follows a young, scarred** **woman who embarks on a cross-country bus journey from her farm in Spruce Pine, North Carolina, all the way to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to be healed by a minister, and discovers the true meaning of beauty along the way.**

*Violet* is a moving musical featuring show-stopping anthems ranging from American-roots to folk to gospel. With a score from Tony-winning composer Jeanine Tesori (*Thoroughly Modern Millie*, *Fun Home*, *Caroline, or Change*), *Violet* is inspired by the short story *The Ugliest Pilgrim* by Doris Betts, astounding critics and audiences alike in two separate decades.

Director Dan Saunders said: "*Violet* is a show with great uplifting music, a diverse cast and lots of scope for play and discovery whilst rehearsing. We hope to create an environment such that the preparation for the run is equally as rewarding and exciting as the run itself. 

“Our ethos is that theatre is a team sport and that when everyone works together, a show can be greater than the sum of its parts, and we can create an experience that is unique and special for cast, crew and audience alike.”

**SPECIAL OFFER:** book any four (or more) shows in Sedos’ 2025 Bridewell season in one transaction and receive 25% off. The discount will be applied automatically at the [online box office](https://sedos.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows).  Please note we have not yet opened the box office for *Hedda Gabler*, so you may wish to wait and book when that final show is on sale.

*Violet* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 25-29 March 2025.
