      >Sedos have once again succeeded in putting on a touching show with
      exceptional acting across the board and one that deals with important
      themes sensitively. This was a wonderful chance to see a relatively
      unknown musical in an intimate venue which is perfect for this show and
      yet another shining example of how wonderful amateur theatre can be when
      done right!

  the Bridewell Theatre from 25-29 March 2025
metaDescription: Violet, by Jeanine Tesori, Brian Crawley and Brian Crawley, is
  a moving and award-winning musical. It is part of Sedos’ 2025 season and plays
  at the Bridewell Theatre from 25-29 March 2025
---
**This award-winning musical follows a young, scarred** **woman who embarks on a cross-country bus journey from her farm in Spruce Pine, North Carolina, all the way to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to be healed by a minister, and discovers the true meaning of beauty along the way.**

*Violet* is a moving musical featuring show-stopping anthems ranging from American-roots to folk to gospel. With a score from Tony-winning composer Jeanine Tesori (*Thoroughly Modern Millie*, *Fun Home*, *Caroline, or Change*), *Violet* is inspired by the short story *The Ugliest Pilgrim* by Doris Betts, astounding critics and audiences alike in two separate decades.

Director Dan Saunders said: "*Violet* is a show with great uplifting music, a diverse cast and lots of scope for play and discovery whilst rehearsing. We hope to create an environment such that the preparation for the run is equally as rewarding and exciting as the run itself. 

“Our ethos is that theatre is a team sport and that when everyone works together, a show can be greater than the sum of its parts, and we can create an experience that is unique and special for cast, crew and audience alike.”

**Content warnings:** the story is set in America, September 1964, where they have just passed the US Civil Rights Act outlawing segreation. 1960s America is still, culturally, changing and moving on from segregated spaces. The story includes discussion of physical disfigurement, themes of racism and racist language, prejudice, discrimination and bias. There are scenes in the story which encourage the misue of alcohol and that portray "GI culture" in the 1960s. The story includes elements of faith and faith healing which may be sensitive for some viewers. The dialogue includes strong language and content (including scenes of intimacy) suited to a mature audience.

**Technical triggers:** this production contains instances of sudden loud noises, haze, smoke and flashing lights. There are no instances of intense "strobe" lighting or simulated firearm noises. 

**SPECIAL OFFER:** book any four (or more) shows in Sedos’ 2025 Bridewell season in one transaction and receive 25% off. The discount will be applied automatically at the [online box office](https://sedos.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows).
