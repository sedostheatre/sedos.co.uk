      >I can think of few amateur companies who would, or could, take on the
      challenge of Brecht’s first play but ever-versatile, adventurous Sedos
      have staged it with confidence, verve and a lot of talent.

**With an insatiable appetite for sex and booze, Baal lives his life for the moment. From stage to sewer he leaves a trail of devastation and recklessly dispensed lyricism in his wake.**

Bertolt Brecht's ﬁrst play, *Baal* rages with the ﬁre of youth. Nothing escapes young Brecht's burning wit and self-immolating irony here. An anti-hero and cult artist at odds with the world, Baal indulges in ﬂeshy decadence spewing surreal poetry and bawdy libretto.

Drunken and depraved, he strips romanticism bare and throws it onto the shit-heap. The secretions that stain Baal's world glisten to reveal the excesses of youth and blind idolatry of creative genius.

This show contains strong language, nudity and scenes of a violent and sexual nature.
