      >This humorous play is full of laughs reminding us of the working man
      ethics of the 1940s. Sedos give this production their all. High production
      values and consistently focused performances by the entire cast make for
      an outstanding performance. Praise must also go to the designers for their
      simple, but extremely effective scenery, and to the crew for the smoothest
      of scene changes, as one comes to expect with a company of this calibre…
      As usual – an outstanding production… With plenty of challenging
      productions every year, ranging from drama to musical theatre, nothing
      frightens this aspiring company whose well-deserved reputation in the
      world of amateur theatre comes from sincerity, dedication and very hard
      work.

**Heaven can wait, but can Joe Pendleton?**

In an ethereal place between heaven and earth, the recently deceased queue to board the heavenly aeroplane. All wait patiently in line, except for one passenger. Boxer Joe Pendleton - an under-educated and 'salt-of-the-earth' sort - insists that he can't be dead, it's all a big mistake.

And indeed he is right...

This charming comic fantasy charts the search for a new body for Joe and his ensuing struggle between ambition and love.

Sedos is proud to present the original 1938 play which inspired a number of hit movies and the cult US TV series *Quantum Leap*.
