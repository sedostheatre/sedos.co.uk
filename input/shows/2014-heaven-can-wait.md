**Heaven can wait, but can Joe Pendleton?**

In an ethereal place between heaven and earth, the recently deceased queue to board the heavenly aeroplane. All wait patiently in line, except for one passenger. Boxer Joe Pendleton - an under-educated and 'salt-of-the-earth' sort - insists that he can't be dead, it's all a big mistake.

And indeed he is right...

This charming comic fantasy charts the search for a new body for Joe and his ensuing struggle between ambition and love.

Sedos is proud to present the original 1938 play which inspired a number of hit movies and the cult US TV series *Quantum Leap*.
