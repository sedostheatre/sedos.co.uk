**One week in July 2005. London feels like the centre of the world.**

*Pornography* is the stark and shattering play by Simon Stephens that captures Britain as it crashes from the euphoria and promise of the 2012 Olympics announcement into the devastation of 7/7.

Written in reaction to the events that occurred that fatal day, *Pornography* offers a kaleidoscopic view of London through seven different seemingly unrelated stories, from an angry racist teenager besotted with his teacher, to a pair of siblings that enter into an incestuous relationship, and eventually one of the bombers himself on his final journey.

>Stephens observes his characters with an almost forensic detachment and yet he makes us love them too. A play of grace and terror.
