> Just so you understand: the problem is not that your're fucking my husband. The problem is that you need to.

**Everyone wants to get to the executive suite. Everyone wants the Delhi job. Everyone wants sex, everyone wants love. So, they push for it. *Push Up* is set in a world we all know: the world of work.**

Set within the headquarters of an expanding corporation, *Push Up*, by contemporary German playwright Roland Schimmelpfennig, explores sexual and political maneuverings in a contest of the survival of the fittest. Competition is fierce and timing is everything. The public face and the private lie collide, relationships become expendable and vanities are stripped bare in this coolly ironic examination of modern behavior in the workplace.

Everyone wants power, success, sex and if time permits, love. Welcome to the world of *Push Up* where a momentary lapse can cost everything.
