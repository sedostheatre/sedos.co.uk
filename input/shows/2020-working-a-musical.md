#### **THIS SHOW HAS BEEN POSTPONED. [FIND OUT MORE](/news/2020-03-26-a-message-to-our-members-and-friends).**

**In 1974 Chicago radio broadcaster Studs Terkel published a best selling compilation of interviews with a cross section of Americans talking about their jobs**.

In 2007-2008 additional interviews were conducted. Terkel described it as ‘the extraordinary dreams of ordinary people’. *Workin*g is the musical adaptation of Terkel’s book, and the words of the people he interviewed. It was first conceived by Stephen Schwartz (*Godspell*, *Pippin*, *Wicked*) and staged on Broadway in 1978.

*Working* is a delightfully funny and thoroughly touching musical which explores what goes through the minds of everyday people - from construction workers and waitresses to firemen, secretaries and cleaning women. It showcases the individuals' occupations and also laments their lost hopes and dreams - taking the average worker's viewpoint and showing that he or she is anything but average.
