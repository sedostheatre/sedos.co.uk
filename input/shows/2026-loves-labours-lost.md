**"Love’s a play. You know the plot. It’s a comedy. Or that’s what people say. Curtain up, you hear your cue. Boys meet girls and then hijinks ensue."**

*Love’s Labour’s Lost* is a sun-drenched musical that reimagines Shakespeare’s comedy as a bittersweet rock musical set at a university college reunion. Alex Timbers and Michael Friedman have combined pop-rock bangers, outrageous gags, and plenty of nods to the original. 

Featuring a riot of vows, disguises, and romance gone wrong – the King and his friends renew a vow they made when they graduated to avoid all pleasures and all women. That plan unravels when the Princess and her companions arrive. This production will question what it means to promise something, and what it means to break it.  Smart, sexy, and gloriously silly, this is Shakespeare like you’ve never seen him before.

“This gleeful riff on Shakespeare is a tall, fruity drink of intoxicating delight. Friedman finds the sweet spot between giddy pop grooves and bruised, ruminating lyrics, creating a dual sensation of silliness and heartache."
*Time Out New York*

Director Owen Thomas James commented: “*Love’s Labour’s Lost* has always been my favourite play. It strikes such a charming balance between sarcastic wit and emotional poignancy, and naturally lends itself to musical accompaniment. This contemporary adaptation makes Shakespeare’s delightful comedy accessible for everyone, with a high energy pop-rock score that pokes fun at the original language and supercharges the silliness. I am absolutely delighted to be directing this for Sedos, who have a strong appetite for bold re-imaginings of the Bard. This is going to be luxurious, laugh-out-loud funny, and deeply relatable, celebrating all of love’s absurdity in the modern world. I can’t wait to get started.”
