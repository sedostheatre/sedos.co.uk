    title: BIG SUNDAY SING-ALONG
    body: >-
      **Come and join us for our biggest sing-along of the season from 9am to
      9pm!** 


      We’ve assembled a squad of musical directors to lead our biggest cast yet (yes that's you!) through a selection of favourites over the course of a Sunday. You’ll learn all of the numbers throughout the day before we put you all together with a live band to enjoy the numbers in their full glory. 


      Whether you’d like to sing in the chorus or perhaps even fancy a cheeky solo line – we’d love to hear from you!


      Certified. Bangers. Guaranteed!


      **Date and time:** Sunday 17 September, 9am


      **Cost:** £10

      **Join production group in the Bridewell as we look into the world of
      lighting.**


      We'll work through some common tasks with the lighting desks (running Eos) that we use in our productions to go through items like: 


      * Powering on the lighting infrastructure and desk and making sure you are show ready 

      * How to op a show on the desk 

      * What to do in the event something goes wrong while op-ing a show 


      In addition, we’ll run through some basic steps that would be used in a focus or to build out the basis of a show including:


      * Turning lights on and off 

      * Recording scenes 

      * Controlling advanced features of lights


      This workshop is aimed at people who are beginners in the world of lighting and Eos desks. However, if you would like to go through any more intermediate / advanced features, please email us on [production@sedos.co.uk](mailto:production@sedos.co.uk) and we’ll look to put something together for you. 


      While this workshop is going on, some other production group members will be looking at maintenance and preparing for Gatsby and Fay which you are also welcome to take part in.


      **Date and time:** Monday 18 September, 9pm


      **Cost:** this is a free event, but it is essential to sign up by booking a free ticket

    title: Gatsby and Fay
    body: >-
      **Gatsby and Fay is a radical queer retelling of the Great Gatsby that’s
      grimmer, glammer, and gayer than ever. Jay Gatsby is the enigmatic trans
      host of London’s most outrageously queer parties. They’re desperate to win
      back their bisexual ex-girlfriend, Daisy Fay Buchanan, five years after
      transphobia drove them apart. But her abusive husband isn’t going to let
      her go.** 


      This play is a celebration of queer growth full of laughter, tears, and a personal look at abuse. 


      Gatsby and Fay is about love. How we idealise our loved ones, how we make excuses for a lover’s bad behaviour, how we value certain types of love over others. And above all, Gatsby and Fay is about what happens when love goes wrong.


      This is a script-in-hand performance after one evening of rehearsal. 


      Check out the full details of [Gatsby and Fay auditions](https://www.sedos.co.uk/events/gatsby-and-fay-auditions). 


      **Date and time:** rehearsal on Tuesday 19 September 7-11pm; performanceWednesday 20 September, 8pm


      **Cost:** free to take part if you are cast


      **Tickets to watch on Wednesday 20 September:** £5
