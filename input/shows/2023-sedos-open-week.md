Youâ€™ll learn all of the numbers throughout the day before we put you all together with a live band to enjoy the numbers in their full glory.Â 


      Whether youâ€™d like to sing in the chorus or perhaps even fancy a cheeky solo line â€“ weâ€™d love to hear from you!


      Certified. Bangers. Guaranteed!


      **Date and time:** Sunday 17 September, 9am


      **Cost:** Â£10

      **Join production group in the Bridewell as we look into the world of
      lighting.**


      We'll work through some common tasks with the lighting desks (running Eos) that we use in our productions to go through items like:Â 


      * Powering on the lighting infrastructure and desk and making sure you are show readyÂ 

      * How to op a show on the deskÂ 

      * What to do in the event something goes wrong while op-ing a showÂ 


      In addition, weâ€™ll run through some basic steps that would be used in a focus or to build out the basis of a show including:


      * Turning lights on and offÂ 

      * Recording scenesÂ 

      * Controlling advanced features of lights


      This workshop is aimed at people who are beginners in the world of lighting and Eos desks. However, if you would like to go through any more intermediate / advanced features, please email us onÂ [production@sedos.co.uk](mailto:production@sedos.co.uk)Â and weâ€™ll look to put something together for you.Â 


      While this workshop is going on, some other production group members will be looking at maintenance and preparing for Gatsby and Fay which you are also welcome to take part in.


      **Date and time:** Monday 18 September, 7pm


      **Cost:** this is a free event, but it is essential to sign up by booking a free ticket

    title: GATSBY AND FAY
    body: >-
      ***Gatsby and Fay* is a radical queer retelling of *The Great Gatsby*
      thatâ€™s grimmer, glammer, and gayer than ever. Jay Gatsby is the enigmatic
      trans host of Londonâ€™s most outrageously queer parties. Theyâ€™re desperate
      to win back their bisexual ex-girlfriend, Daisy Fay Buchanan, five years
      after transphobia drove them apart. But her abusive husband isnâ€™t going to
      let her go.**Â 


      This play is a celebration of queer growth full of laughter, tears, and a personal look at abuse.Â 


      *Gatsby and Fay* is about love. How we idealise our loved ones, how we make excuses for a loverâ€™s bad behaviour, how we value certain types of love over others. And above all, *Gatsby and Fay* is about what happens when love goes wrong.


      This is a script-in-hand performance after one evening of rehearsal. 


      Check out the full details of [*Gatsby and Fay* auditions](https://www.sedos.co.uk/events/gatsby-and-fay-auditions). 


      **Date and time:** rehearsal on Tuesday 19 September 7-11pm; performance on Wednesday 20 September, 8pm


      **Cost:** free to take part if you are cast\

      **Tickets to watch on Wednesday 20 September:** Â£5
