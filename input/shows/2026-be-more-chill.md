**Jeremy Heere is just an average nerdy teenager trying to survive his last year of high school. Bullied and mocked by his peers, and feeling let down by his recently divorced father, Jeremy wants nothing more than to fit in and be one of the cool kids.** 

That’s when he finds out about “The Squip”; a tiny supercomputer from Japan that promises to solve all his problems, make life easier, and get him everything he desires. Suddenly, he’s being invited to the coolest parties of the year, he’s celebrated in the halls, and he’s got a date with the second most popular girl in school. 

But is being popular worth sacrificing control of your life to a supercomputer? 

Director Miranda Evans commented: “*Be More Chill* is an explosion of catchy tunes and geeky video game nostalgia, with a heart that speaks to that lonely teen in all of us. In our current technological era, a story about handing over your life to a sentient supercomputer feels more resonant than ever. The show found its audience online where it became a bit of a cult classic. This is where I discovered the soundtrack, and it quickly became one of my favourite shows. I am thrilled to be bringing to the Bridewell with Sedos as part of the 2026 season.”

*Be More Chill* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 20-24 October 2026.
