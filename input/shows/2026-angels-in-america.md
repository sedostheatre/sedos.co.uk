**“With faith and time and hard work you reach a point where… where the disappointment doesn’t hurt as much, and then it gets actually easy to live with. Quite easy. Which is in its own way a disappointment.”**

Tony Kushner’s *Angels in America* is a sweeping, poetic two-part epic play about love, loss, and the search for meaning at the height of the 1980s AIDS crisis. 

Blending piercing political insight with flights of magic and imagination – and a nostalgic nod to the music of the era – it follows a group of New Yorkers whose lives collide in moments of heartbreak, revelation, and unexpected hope. At once intimate and vast, tragic and funny, the play asks timeless questions about identity, faith, and human resilience – reminding us that even in the darkest times, there is possibility, transformation, and the promise of more life. 

Following the international acclaim of the National Theatre revival and the celebrated HBO miniseries, Sedos takes a daring artistic leap with a boldly re-envisioned experience for the intimate stage, offering a fresh, immediate encounter with Kushner’s masterpiece. 

Both parts will be offered in a unique theatrical experience at the Bridewell in November 2026. Do not miss out on the event of the ‘Millenium’.

Director David Gregory commented: "Directing *Angels in America* is both a challenge and a privilege… it’s like being handed a theatrical universe. Kushner’s writing is vast, poetic, and fiercely political, yet rooted in the most intimate human emotions. To stage it is to wrestle with angels and ghosts, with love and fear, with the very question of what theatre can do. Every scene asks for invention: conjuring visions, collapsing time, making the impossible suddenly real. It’s going to be exhilarating to guide actors through this landscape, to discover new layers in characters that feel endlessly alive, and to invite an audience into an experience that promises to be funny, devastating, and transcendent. This isn’t just another play – it’s a once-in-a-lifetime journey for all of us at Sedos and all of our audiences. And directing it feels like being at the helm of something truly extraordinary."
