      >This production, a Minack debut for Sedos which usually performs just off
      Fleet Street, classily directed by Roger Harwood and Dawn
      Harrison-Wallace, dances us through his amazing, sometimes outrageous,
      ultimately poignant life story, on a triumph of an Art Deco set designed
      by Steven King… This is glamour with bucketfuls of fizz, and a feeling of
      extravagant luxury washes over us as the Sedos singers seemingly
      effortlessly swing through around 50 famous numbers with on-stage
      pianists, musical director Matt Gould and Ryan Macaulay, the brilliant
      Annette Brown tooting and drumming, and the Minack’s executive director
      Zoe Curnow having her own party on double bass. Matt and Ryan are a
      delightful duo, tap dancing too, with narration by the ultra smooth James
      Franey as Cole, joined by Liz Flint as his wife Linda in shimmering
      emerald silk, backed by Stephen Beeney, Susan Booth, Rachel
      Elfassy-Bitoun, Will Garood, Deborah Lean, Yvette Shiel and Alex
      Yelland.Producer Lizzie Levett, choreographer Jane Saunders, sound and
      lighting Adam Coppard and Olly Levett, and stage manager Andrew Laidlaw
      and team make it all so believable. When’s the next party?

**An elegant cabaret-style tribute to the life of Cole Porter, one of the greatest composers and lyricists of the 20th century. Through words and music,*A Swell Party* celebrates the vibrant image of sophistication and glamour that Cole represented for so long to so many people.**

First staged at the West End's Vaudeville Theatre in 1991, *A Swell Party* celebrates the spirit of the songwriter through words and music and includes classic songs such as 'I Get A Kick Out of You', 'I've Got You Under My Skin', 'Brush Up Your Shakespeare' and 'Night and Day', from shows such as High Society, Kiss Me Kate and Anything Goes.

You're invited to join this swell party to marvel at Cole's effervescent witty lyrics, occasional ribald humour, consummate song writing and catchy melodies live onstage. Cole Porter, you’re the top!

*A Swell Party* is Sedos' debut production at the Minack Theatre, Cornwall.
