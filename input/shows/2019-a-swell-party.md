      #### **A Swell Party – Review SEDOS**

      ***reviewed by Jenni Balow***


      What a swell party that was! With gorgeous girls, simply oodles of
      champagne, and even lovelier boys, who could want for anything more.


      Cole Porter was in a class of his own, writing both the words and the
      music to more than 800 cleverly original songs during the Thirties and
      Forties, throwing lavish parties around the world, and not giving a damn
      over his sexual preference for men, even if it was illegal at the time.


      But what is fascinating, and I didn’t know it before watching this
      celebration of his life and work, was the tragedy of a riding accident
      that happened at the height of his fame. His legs were crushed when his
      horse fell and rolled on him, but despite the pain and many operations
      before a final amputation, he still worked.


      And his best Broadway hits, *Kiss Me Kate*, and *High Society*, which
      starred Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra, were the result.


      Porter was born wealthy, an American man of impeccable taste, who was sent
      to Harvard to study Law, but preferred Music.


      This production, a Minack debut for SEDOS which usually performs just off
      Fleet Street, classily directed by Roger Harwood and Dawn
      Harrison-Wallace, dances us through his amazing, sometimes outrageous,
      ultimately poignant life story, on a triumph of an Art Deco set designed
      by Steven King.


      At its heart, two grand pianos stand on stylish black and white patterned
      floor roundels, complemented by a heavy red leather chesterfield sofa,
      period screens, sideboard and trolleys set with crystal decanters and a
      never-ending supply of dry martini.


      And of course, a ‘roomful’ of beautiful people, the immaculately coiffured
      scarlet-lipsticked women wearing diamonds and dresses to die for, the men
      equally fine in tuxedos and bow ties.


      What is stunning, is the way they move into natural groups, standing at a
      balustrade to gaze out to sea, and gathering around the pianos to sing,
      all looking as though they were to this manner born.


      This is glamour with bucketfuls of fizz, and a feeling of extravagant
      luxury washes over us as the SEDOS singers seemingly effortlessly swing
      through around 50 famous numbers with on-stage pianists, musical director
      Matt Gould and Ryan Macaulay, the brilliant Annette Brown tooting and
      drumming, and the Minack’s executive director Zoe Curnow having her own
      party on double bass.


      Matt and Ryan are a delightful duo, tap dancing too, with narration by the
      ultra smooth James Franey as Cole, joined by Liz Flint as his wife Linda
      in shimmering emerald silk, backed by Stephen Beeney, Susan Booth, Rachel
      Elfassy-Bitoun, Will Garood, Deborah Lean, Yvette Shiel and Alex Yelland.


      Producer Lizzie Levett, choreographer Jane Saunders, sound and lighting
      Adam Coppard and Olly Levett, and stage manager Andrew Laidlaw and team
      make it all so believable.


      When’s the next party?

***Have you heard? It's in the stars***\
***Next July we collide with Mars.***\
***Well, did you evah?***\
***What a swell party, a swell party***\
***A swelligant, elegant party this is!***

An elegant cabaret-style tribute to the life of Cole Porter, one of the greatest composers and lyricists of the 20th century. Through words and music,*A Swell Party*celebrates the vibrant image of sophistication and glamour that Cole represented for so long to so many people.

First staged at the West End's Vaudeville Theatre in 1991,*A Swell Party*celebrates the spirit of the songwriter through words and music and includes classic songs such as 'I Get A Kick Out of You', 'I've Got You Under My Skin', 'Brush Up Your Shakespeare' and 'Night and Day', from shows such as High Society, Kiss Me Kate and Anything Goes.

You're invited to join this swell party to marvel at Cole's effervescent witty lyrics, occasional ribald humour, consummate song writing and catchy melodies live onstage. Cole Porter, you’re the top!

*A Swell Party*is Sedos' debut production at the Minack Theatre, Cornwall.
