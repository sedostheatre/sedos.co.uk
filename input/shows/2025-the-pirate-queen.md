***The Pirate Queen* is an epic musical adventure celebrating the legendary Irish chieftain Grace O’Malley.** 

Could you stand by while your homeland was taken over? Gráinne (Grace) could not. Based on the real life of Gráinne Ní Mháille, anglicised as Grace O’Malley, *The Pirate Queen* showcases the resistance of the Irish clans against English occupation in Renaissance Ireland. 

A thrilling mixture of romance, sword fighting, politics, and piracy, this show by Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil (*Les Misérables*, *Miss Saigon*), asks how far you would go to protect what you love. 

With Irish music and dance woven throughout, *The Pirate Queen* explores what it is to be trapped by societal expectations of gender, culture and tradition. Can Grace find a way to negotiate peace with the powerful Queen Elizabeth I?

This is the second time Sedos has had an opportunity to tour a show to the [Minack Theatre](https://minack.com/) in Porthcurno, Cornwall. The Minack is one of the most beautiful open-air theatres in the world and we’ll be looking for a big, diverse cast to share this exciting experience. Auditions will be held in February and the full audition notice will be released in due course. Email [piratequeen@sedos.co.uk](mailto:piratequeen@sedos.co.uk) if you’d like to be sent the audition notice once it’s available. 

Director Katie Porter said: "It’s always exciting to see shows where women are in positions of power and have struggled to overcome the limitations placed on them by society. As an Irish woman, it is doubly exciting to have a show steeped in Irish history and culture. 

"*The Pirate Queen* focuses on Gráinne's (Grace’s) journey against the oppression of the patriarchy and the English conquest of Ireland. Women still struggle against similar expectations today, and I find it refreshing to have a female protagonist and antagonist.

"Set in the reign of Elizabeth I, the show explicitly explores the impacts of colonial rule in Ireland, offering audiences a different perspective to the British Imperialism that is generally taught within the UK. As the western world begins to unpick their own history of colonisation, I feel it’s an important time to hear the stories of resistance and perseverance.

"While Gráinne’s skill with a sword is highly praised, *The Pirate Queen* also highlights her political savvy – she will do whatever she can to protect her clan and preserve Irish traditions. I’m hoping to pick up that torch in bringing Irish culture and tradition to the Cornwall coast as we remember Grace O’Malley’s story."

**Content warnings:** The show includes themes of death, violence and misogyny. 

*The Pirate Queen* plays at the [Minack Theatre](https://www.minack.com/), Cornwall, from 30 June-3 July 2025. Tickets will go on sale in February.
