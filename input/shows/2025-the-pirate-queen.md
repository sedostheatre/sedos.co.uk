***The Pirate Queen* is an epic musical adventure celebrating the legendary Irish Chieftain Grace O'Malley.** 

Based on her real-life story, Grace is a compelling, inspiring heroine who led an extraordinary life as a pirate, lover and mother in 16th-century Ireland. To protect her people and save her one true love, O'Malley must confront the one woman more powerful than her — her fierce rival, Queen Elizabeth I of England.

From the writers of *Les Miserables* and *Miss Saigon*, the show combines classic storytelling and a sweeping score, with the powerful, vibrant traditions of Irish dance and song, to create a modern musical event that is both an historic romance and a timeless epic.

*The Pirate Queen* plays at the [Minack Theatre](https://www.minack.com/), Cornwall, from 29 June-3 July 2025.
