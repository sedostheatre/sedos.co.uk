>When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? Perhaps to be too practical is madness. To surrender dreams – this may be madness. To seek treasure where there is only trash. Too much sanity may be madness. And maddest of all, to see life as it is and not as it should be.

**Out of the dungeon of despair, the story of knight errant Don Quixote rises in triumphant transformation in the classic musical *Man of La Mancha*.**

Inspired by one of the greatest novels of all time, this tuneful celebration of the human spirit features Miguel de Cervantes and his faithful servant, who channel the power of storytelling to recount the legend of wannabe knight Don Quixote and his trusty sidekick Sancho as they embark on a journey full of laughter, love and unruly windmills.
