**Five of Rudyard Kipling’s Just So Stories come together into a wondrous tale of personal courage, individuality and friendship. Set to an eclectic, upbeat score, Kipling’s famous tales are woven with wit and imagination into a song-filled journey through the jungle.**\
\
Join us on this journey with the young, effervescent and inquisitive Elephant’s Child and the sassy, sarcastic and flightless Kolokolo Bird as they set out to save their friends and family from the wicked Pau Amma who is threatening their homeland.

On our journey through this magical tale, we’ll meet a wide array of fun loving characters, from a Kangaroo who is shocked to see the rate at which his legs have grown, to a Parsee Man who lives seemingly alone with his seemingly inanimate stove…

Let the Eldest Magician take you on this wondrous tale through lush jungles, dusty savannahs and the ever looming great, grey and greasy Limpopo River in “Just So” this March. 

Just So plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 5-9 March 2024.
