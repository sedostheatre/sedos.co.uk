> Careful the things you say, children will listen. Careful the things you do, children will see and learn.

**Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom lived a young maiden, a sad young lad and a childless baker with his wife.**

Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine reimagine the magical world of fairy tales in their multi award winning musical fantasy *Into the Woods*, arguably the composer's most successful show. Familiar childhood stories are woven together in this darkly enchanting musical about life after the 'happily ever after'.

The baker and his wife enter the wood to lift the curse on their family, but in their quest for a child they must face the consequences of getting 'everything they ever wanted'.\
\
Cinderella wishes to go to the ball. Jack doesn’t want sell his cow. Little Red Riding Hood wants to visit her grandmother, but gets waylaid by a wolf. A prince hears Rapunzel singing in her tower and falls in love.\
\
Cinderella meets and marries her prince, but is it really 'happy ever after'? After all, he is a complete stranger. The baker and his wife steal and lie to get the ingredients for the spell. Jack kills a giant — but giants are just like us, but bigger, and the grieving giant’s wife starts to destroy the kingdom.\
\
Actions have consequences. Fairy tales are not just playful stories. The woods are fearful and deep and dark, but you can’t just act — you have to listen, you have to think. Will you take the right path?

The production features the full 15 piece orchestration by Jonathan Tunick.
