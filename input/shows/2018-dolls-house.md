> I think I’m a human being before anything else. I don’t care what other people say. I don’t care what people write in books. I need to think for myself.

**Henrik Ibsen’s *A Doll’s House* premiered in 1879 in Copenhagen provoking huge controversy within its apparently feminist message and cemented Ibsen’s commitment to realist drama. In Ibsen’s play, Nora Helmer has secretly borrowed a large amount of money to pay for her husband, Torvald to recover from illness on a sabbatical in Italy. Torvald’s perception of Nora is of a silly, naive spendthrift, so it is only when the truth begins to emerge and Torvald realises who Nora really is that unbendable cracks appear in their marriage.**

Ibsen’s masterpiece examines the way society shapes us and our conception of others. It considers marriage, family, money and the roles of both men and women in a play famous for its flawed and realistic characters.

Simon Stephens vibrant, compelling translation of *A Doll’s House* premiered at the Young Vic Theatre, London, in 2012.
