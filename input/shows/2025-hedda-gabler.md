**Hedda is a rapidly unravelling new bride.**

The daughter of the late General Gabler and now the wife of up-and-coming academic Jorgen Tesman, something is dawning on Hedda: somehow, she’s stumbled into a life that looks increasingly ‘ordinary’ - and it’s suffocating her.

Always seemingly defined by her relationship to someone else, Hedda obsessively covets three intoxicating characteristics for herself that she sees in the men around her: ambition, hedonism and control.

Gone are the ruffs, corsets and bluster. Join us at the Bridewell to see how Hedda’s dangerous games play out – because not everyone is getting out alive.

In a visceral new version by Patrick Marber (*Dealer's Choice*, *Closer*) which opened at the National Theatre in December 2016, Ibsen's subtle psychological tragedy is transformed into something more brutal, confrontational and raw. *The Telegraph* hailed it as "a bold, clear, finally harrowing account of the play".

*Hedda Gabler (Marber)* in this version was first presented in the Lyttelton auditorium of the National Theatre, London, on 5 December 2016.

This is the second time Sedos has performed a play by Ibsen, following *[A Doll’s House](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2018-dolls-house)* in January 2018. It is also the second play that Jonny Harding-Cooper has directed for Sedos, following *[The Effect](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2023-the-effect)* in 2023.
