      >The displays of telekinesis in action are worth seeing, as are the prom
      costumes. This is amateur dramatics at its finest: forget backing tracks –
      Rob Archibald leads a seven-piece band – and it’s difficult to pick a
      stand-out performance in a cast so finely balanced. The shock horror
      factor may not be prevalent, but the portrayal of bullying, intimidation
      and a sense of not fitting in is more than sufficiently disconcerting. Not
      one for the fainthearted.

      >There are clearly many technical elements needed for a show like Carrie in order to display her telekinesis and whilst I do not want to give any spoilers away Sedos interpretation of this was exceptional. It meant that Carrie’s moments where her telekinesis flared up were some of my highlights of the show. I must commend Chris Adams and Paul Brookland Williams (director and movement director) for the courage to take this route as well as Polly Hayes for her vital part in it. Other elements such as flashing lights and windows slamming shut were all well thought out and timed well to add to the suspense of the show. Once again Sedos have presented a rarely performed musical to a wider audience and judging from the sell out audiences I was not the only one excited by this. With a talented cast and a strong direction for the piece Sedos have once again presented a show that I would urge people to see….. if it wasn’t sold out already!

      >Just as you think you’ve seen the very best Sedos has to offer they give us something even better. It’s a good musical but Sedos has turned it into something extraordinary. Brilliant! The audience were gripped from the opening moment to the final curtain calls.

      >As ever, Sedos bring their customary skill and ability to the performance, the ensemble songs in particular being tightly controlled, crisply delivered and well sung, with excellent work from Movement Director Paul Brookland Williams.

**Carrie White is a misfit. At school, she's an outcast who's bullied by the popular crowd, and virtually invisible to everyone else. At home, she's at the mercy of her over-protective, hyper-religious mother. But there’s something different about Carrie – she has a special power. A power that can be destructive. And if she’s pushed too far, she may have to use it…**

Based on Stephen King's bestselling novel and the acclaimed movie starring Sissy Spacek, Carrie has been reinvented for our time in a new production sure to shake the Bridewell to its very core...

Carrie contains adult themes, violence and strong language. Special effects include strobe lighting, bright flashes, loud/sudden noises, haze/smoke and fake blood. We recommend Carrie for an adult audience.

*Carrie: The Musical* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 25-29 October 2022.

This amateur production of *Carrie: The Musical* is presented by arrangement with Concord Theatricals Ltd. www.concordtheatricals.co.uk
