> “If I could, I’d bring them all down to their knees!\
> I’d make them sorry forever for teasing Carrie!”

**Carrie White is a misfit. At school, she's an outcast who's bullied by the popular crowd, and virtually invisible to everyone else. At home, she's at the mercy of her over-protective, hyper-religious mother. But there’s something different about Carrie – she has a special power. A power that can be destructive. And if she’s pushed too far, she may have to use it…**
