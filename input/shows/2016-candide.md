> The best of all possible worlds

**Based on Voltaire's 1759 novella of the same name, *Candide* is a masterpiece from the greats of musical theatre. The show combines a beautiful score with a fast-paced, witty book in a joyful and hilarious operetta which as been delighting audiences for 60 years.**

A naïve young man, Candide, is thrown out of the Baron of Thunder-Den-Tronck's castle when he attempts to marry the Baron's daughter Cunegonde. They embark on a round-the-world journey in which their idealistic belief that all's for the best in this "best of all possible worlds" is challenged by a series of absurd misfortunes.

Among their adventures, Candide, Cunegonde and their friends become tangled up in wars, shipwrecked, cheated out of a fortune, repeatedly separated, forced into prostitution and marriage, and struggle to determine the meaning of life.
