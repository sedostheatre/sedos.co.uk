**Sedos’ production of the musical comedy *Hot Mikado*, based on Gilbert and Sullivan’s *The Mikado* and adapted by David H. Bell (book and lyrics) and Rob Bowman (orchestrations and arrangements), sees East meet gangster Chicago head-on as the clean lines and colour of Japanese design combine with the big band sights and sounds of popular American song and dance.**

The show opens in the late 1930s, at the tail end of prohibition, and then transports you to the fantasy city of Titipu where a ban on flirting has just been passed. A cast of loveable characters bring to life a story of disguise, intrigue, star-crossed lovers and – hopefully! – a happy ending for all.

Featuring an intoxicating mix of dance and musical styles from blues to swing to gospel, and a few surprises along the way, classics like 'A Wand’ring Minstrel I' and 'Three Little Maids' are transformed into show-stopping numbers that will have you singing in the aisles.
