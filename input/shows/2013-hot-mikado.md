      >Sedos certainly takes the spirit of the piece and entertained the
      audience with a sizzling production and a great night out. From the
      opening number when the scantily clad ladies of Japan burst onto the stage
      to the grand finale the company combined set, costume, staging and
      lighting with some brilliant performances to provide an excellent night
      out…

      >In a time of talentless reality TV shows, spending a Saturday evening watching some genuine talent is a breath of fresh air. Observing such an obviously hard-working cast put together such an effervescent show is exciting and thrilling, making this the light-hearted fun that musical theatre often misses the mark with. You’ll have ‘Three Little Maids’ stuck in your head all week…

      >This production of Hot Mikado by the Sedos theatre company is a little jewel that you should not miss and that hopefully will find a bigger showcase and a re-run (a longer run!) at the Bridewell Theatre or, why not?, a bigger location! (anyone reading there???)… The run (for now) is short and you should not miss it but I am pretty sure someone will notice this show and hopefully we’ll get new dates. It really is worth it — get your tickets…

      >The cast remain totally focussed throughout the show. Their tight harmonies and excellent diction combine with strong and varied dance routines to give us a thoroughly enjoyable and beautifully costumed performance. Sedos know exactly how to capture an audience, hold it firmly in the palms of their hands, and then send it on its way, humming those compulsive ear worms – the catchy tunes you just can’t get out of your head…

**Sedos’ production of the musical comedy *Hot Mikado*, based on Gilbert and Sullivan’s *The Mikado* and adapted by David H. Bell (book and lyrics) and Rob Bowman (orchestrations and arrangements), sees East meet gangster Chicago head-on as the clean lines and colour of Japanese design combine with the big band sights and sounds of popular American song and dance.**

The show opens in the late 1930s, at the tail end of prohibition, and then transports you to the fantasy city of Titipu where a ban on flirting has just been passed. A cast of loveable characters bring to life a story of disguise, intrigue, star-crossed lovers and – hopefully! – a happy ending for all.

Featuring an intoxicating mix of dance and musical styles from blues to swing to gospel, and a few surprises along the way, classics like 'A Wand’ring Minstrel I' and 'Three Little Maids' are transformed into show-stopping numbers that will have you singing in the aisles.
