      >[Sedos] should be credited as one of the premier \[amateur] companies in
      the country, as their track record for staging professional-standard shows
      proves… it was a genius stroke by co-directors Roger Harwood and Dawn
      Harrison-Wallace to stage the entire show as a flashback… the casting was
      difficult to fault… \[the cast] all did a great job of bringing the show
      to life… top marks must go to the costume team for their fantastic work…
      \[musical director] David Griffiths and his musicians gave a performance
      grander than many of those you'd hear in West End theatres…
      Congratulations again to Sedos for another great production…

**From the team who brought you Sedos’s acclaimed productions of *Sweeney Todd* and *Kiss of the Spider Woman: the Musical* comes this achingly beautiful musical about love, memory and midsummer magic.**

In turn of the century Sweden, lawyer Fredrik Egerman is married to 18-year-old Anne, who, although they have been married almost a year, is still a virgin. As a treat for her, he buys tickets to see the actress Desirée Armfeldt (an old flame) in a play. Later that night, in Desirée’s digs, the romance is rekindled.

But Desirée has been having an affair with a jealous, military man, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm, husband to the long-suffering Charlotte. And Fredrik’s son, Henrik, is in love with his stepmother Anne. What happens when they all converge at the grand estate of Desirée’s mother, Madame Armfeldt, for a weekend in the country?

Humorous and heart breaking, *A Little Night Music* is a glorious waltz through the tangled web of romance as everybody searches for their perfect match.
