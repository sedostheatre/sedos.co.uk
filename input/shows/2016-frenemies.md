**Sedos on tour to London and Edinburgh with a comedy about the people you hate.**

A show about those people you love to hate. That bitch co-worker? That arsehole flatmate? That annoying prick you can't even remember becoming friends with? They are all in there.

Six short plays from international writers presented over the course of one hour. Each play is comedy driven with strong dramatic elements in some. The plays will share a stylistic theme as well as the general theme of 'Frenemies' to create a cohesive show performed by an ensemble of eight actors.

The plays featured in *Frenemies* are:

**I Can Tell Your Handbag is Fake**, *by Dean Lundquist* \
Three fashion-conscious friends meet on the underground where one of them, much to chagrin of the others, points out that she can tell that their handbags are fake. A commentary on what fashion means to identity.

**Necessity**, *by Daniel Saunders* \
Two men are stranded on a raft in the middle of the ocean after their ship sinks. Is it worth trying to stay alive if your only companion makes you want to kill yourself?

**The Kill**, *by Alex Broun*\
 If you dream you die, you die right? Well what if someone else dies in your dream? Or what if you dream you kill them? And what if that person is sitting beside you on the couch, watching the TV? A psychological dream-thriller. With tomatoes.

**Wanna Hear a Joke?**, *by Daniel Saunders* \
Some people can really make a joke come alive. Sometimes that’s not a good thing. A play about those annoying people you put up with because you want to be a good person.

**Principles**, *by Deborah Poznansky* \
Parent teacher meetings are never fun for anyone. Least of all when it is the adults that are the ones acting like children.

**Perfect Couple**, *by Chris Davis* \
Beatrice and Hugo are the perfect couple. Nice house, recent promotion, soon to be married. A veritable Barbie and Ken. How are Toby and Jenny ever supposed to keep up?
