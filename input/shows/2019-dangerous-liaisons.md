      >As a long-time fan of Sedos, I was excited to be able to attend the first
      night of their first full dance production… Rest assured, my expectations
      were exceeded on both counts as the evening unfolded into a masterclass of
      dramatic contemporary dance which fully captured the themes of seduction
      and revenge of the original play. Each Sedos season showcases a range of
      plays and musicals, from popular, well-loved classics to lesser-known and
      newer works which can challenge both cast and audience. Their weekly
      Sedance class obviously attracts enthusiastic and highly competent
      dancers, and the decision to use this to add a new artform to their
      repertoire was brilliant and will hopefully herald more in the future. I
      can only add that they have set the bar very high with this one… It was a
      fantastic experience to be in the performance space with the dancers,
      feeling their every breath, absorbing their energy and watching the skill
      of their performance. Congratulations to everyone involved for the faith
      in what you were creating - you achieved what you set out to do with bells
      on!

      >A performance of this style is incredibly ambitious for any professional dance troop. What makes this more impressive is that an amateur dramatics society created all of this. Sedos are known for their incredibly high-quality shows, but Dangerous Liaisons has put them on a whole different level. This production with these incredible performers would not be out of place on a West End stage.

      >The dancing is gorgeous, athletic and very expressive. The performance space is tiny, so you are up close and personal with the dancers/actors, and they absolutely carry you along with the story… Sedos is an amateur company, but there is nothing amateurish about this show – it’s ambitious, clever and exciting, but also beautifully economical and precise.

**It got a facelift in the 90s with *Cruel Intentions* and now Sedos brings a fresh new take on the classic story of seduction, betrayal and exploitation.**

Be transported to Hollywood where beauty is expected, abuses of power lurk under the shiny surface and the rivalry of two high powered producers set in motion a story that will create stars and destroy lives.

Told through dance, experience an original adaptation that brings *Dangerous Liaisons* crashing into the gender politics of 2019.
