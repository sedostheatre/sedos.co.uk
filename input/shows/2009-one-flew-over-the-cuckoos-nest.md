**Set in a state mental institution in America the 1960s, *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next* has as its hero Randle P MacMurphy, a loving, fighting, gambling life-affirming brawler who swaggers into the hospital, rallies the other patients and challenges the dictatorship of the Big Nurse. But this defiance, which starts as a sport, soon turns into a grim struggle; an all out war between authority and free will, ending in a shocking climax.**\

At once hilarious and heroic, tragic and liberating, Sedos is delighted to present this all time classic play.
