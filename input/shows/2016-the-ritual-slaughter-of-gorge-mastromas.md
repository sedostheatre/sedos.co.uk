> **The three golden rules.**\
> **Whenever you want something take it.**\
> **All that is required to take everything you want is absolute will and an ability to lie to the depths of your heart.**\
> **Never think of the outcome, assume discovery, embrace each second as if it were your last.**\
> **Never ever regret.**

**A pantheon of seven unnamed gods, lost in time, recall to the audience the life of Gorge Mastromas. A dark epic tale chronicling the life of Gorge Mastromas, a Kane-like figure who rises to become one of the richest, most influential and ruthless people in the world.**

Born with an innate sense of goodness, even when it is detrimental to him, he is repeatedly let down by life, until a pivotal moment in adulthood, when a chance encounter with a ruthless executive breaks down his good nature.

He then becomes one of the most amoral people in the world, lying, cheating and corrupting his way to the top, constructing a web of lies around himself that affect and destroy all close to him, then the world itself, and finally himself.

*The Ritual Slaughter of Gorge Mastromas* premiered in 2013 at the Royal Court Theatre. It is written by award-winning playwright Dennis Kelly, best known for writing the book to *Matilda the Musical* for the RSC and creating the series *Utopia* for Channel Four.
