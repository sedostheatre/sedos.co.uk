**This August, Sedos will be returning to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival with a production of *As You Like It*, a firm favourite among Shakespeare's comedies. This will be Sedos' fifth Edinburgh tour, after the hugely successful double bill of *Sexual Peversity in Chicago* and *Six Degrees of Separation* in 2005, *Mary Stuart* and *The Odd Couple* in 2007, *Don Carlos* in 2008 and *The Tragedy of the Prince of Denmark* in 2010.**

Rosalind, the daughter of a banished duke, falls in love with Orlando at a wrestling match, but her usurping uncle, jealous of her popularity, banishes her from court. Disguised as a boy she seeks out her father and his friends in the Forest of Arden. Here she meets Orlando again and, under the guise of a young man, counsels him in the art of love.

Unable to act on their feelings and forced into exile in the Forest of Arden, lovers Rosalind and Orlando become entangled in a beguiling game of love, lust and mistaken identity.

One of Shakespeare's great comedies, *As You Like It* subverts the traditional rules of romance. Gender roles nature and politics are confused in a play that reflects on how bewildering yet utterly pleasurable life can be.
