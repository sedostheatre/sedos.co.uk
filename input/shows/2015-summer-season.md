      We look forward to welcoming audiences to the Bridewell for our Summer
      Season week. These shows are all being created with limited rehearsal time
      and resources, so will not be fully polished performances, but a chance to
      sample black box, workshop-style theatre.

      **BISHOPSGATE WORKSHOPS**


      **Ballroom Dance For Actors Bishopsgate Institute**\

      **Sunday 12 July, 11am-4.30pm**\

      Whether you are a trained dancer or not, this workshop will demystify ballroom dance so that in future you can use it to support your acting choices rather than being a barrier. Participants will be taught basic steps, hold and movement around the floor before moving onto acting exercises while dancing.


      **New Life Into Tired Songs Bishopsgate Institute**\

      **Saturday 18 July, 11am-4.30pm**\

      This workshop will help singers refresh much-loved but perhaps over-worked songs. We will take an acting approach to the text and its delivery, to help singers explore new ways of delivering songs they probably know well, with a view to broadening their audition and other performance choices.
