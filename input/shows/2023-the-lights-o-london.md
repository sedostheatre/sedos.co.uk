**After a successful Sedos Reads live performance in March 2021, we are delighted to mount a full production of the epic Victorian melodrama *The Lights O' London*.**

A wonderfully exciting mixture of melodrama, comedy and romance, *The Lights o’ London* is the sort of thing we watch on tv or at the movies nowadays. It was written for the actor manager Wilson Barrett by one of the leading writers of the day, George R. Sims, in 1881, a time of novelty, spectacle, and a theatre public comprising a growing and demanding middle class clientele.

Although melodramas had been staged for the majority of the nineteenth century, *The Lights o' London* went beyond much of the shallow characterisation and stock situations with its life-like characters and fast-moving plot. The humour which runs through the play also stops it falling into sentimentality. 

As one of the travelling players says of his wife, "If you see her play Lady Macbeth, she's that natural.the audience sometimes go out and fetch the police."
