**In the court of the Austrian Emperor Joseph II, Antonio Salieri is the established composer. Enter the greatest musical genius of all time: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Salieri has given himself to God so that he might realise his sole ambition, to be a great composer. Mozart is a foul-mouthed, graceless oaf who has that which is beyond Salieri’s envious grasp: genius.**

A fictionalized account of the relationship between these two real life composers, Peter Shaffer’s *Amadeus* takes us on a wild ride through the trials and tribulations of genius, jealousy and revenge.
