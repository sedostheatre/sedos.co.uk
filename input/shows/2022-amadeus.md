metaDescription: Amadeus, part of Sedos’ 2022 London season, plays at the
  Bridewell Theatre from 23 November-3 December 2022. Genius, jealousy and
  revenge mingle in Peter Shaffer’s great play

> I looked on astounded as from his ordinary life he made his art. We were both ordinary men, he and I. Yet from the ordinary he created Legends - and I from Legends created only the ordinary!



**Music, genius, jealousy and revenge.**

**Antonio Salieri is the established composer in the Austrian court. Enter the greatest musical genius of all time: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Salieri has given himself to God so that he might realise his sole ambition, to be a great composer. Mozart is a foul-mouthed, graceless oaf, but he has something which is far beyond Salieri’s envious grasp: genius.**

Peter Shaffer’s award-winning fictionalised account of the relationship between these two real life composers is a story for all time. Presented in a way which reaches far beyond the play’s historical roots, this production of Amadeus takes the audience on a wild ride through the trials and tribulations of music, genius, jealousy and revenge.

*Amadeus* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 23 November-3 December 2022.

This amateur production of *Amadeus* is presented by arrangement with Concord Theatricals Ltd. on behalf of Samuel French Ltd. www.concordtheatricals.co.uk
