**Music, genius, jealousy and revenge.**

**Antonio Salieri is the established composer in the Austrian court. Enter the greatest musical genius of all time: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Salieri has given himself to God so that he might realise his sole ambition, to be a great composer. Mozart is a foul-mouthed, graceless oaf, but he has something which is far beyond Salieri’s envious grasp: genius.**

Peter Shaffer’s award-winning fictionalised account of the relationship between these two real life composers is a story for all time. Presented in a way which reaches far beyond the play’s historical roots, this production of Amadeus takes the audience on a wild ride through the trials and tribulations of music, genius, jealousy and revenge.

*Amadeus* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 23 November-3 December 2022.

This amateur production of *Amadeus* is presented by arrangement with Concord Theatricals Ltd. on behalf of Samuel French Ltd. www.concordtheatricals.co.uk
