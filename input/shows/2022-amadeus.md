> I looked on astounded as from his ordinary life he made his art. We were both ordinary men, he and I. Yet from the ordinary he created Legends - and I from Legends created only the ordinary!

**In the court of the Austrian Emperor Joseph II, Antonio Salieri is the established composer. Enter the greatest musical genius of all time: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Salieri has given himself to God so that he might realise his sole ambition, to be a great composer. Mozart is a foul-mouthed, graceless oaf who has that which is beyond Salieri’s envious grasp: genius.**

A fictionalized account of the relationship between these two real life composers, Peter Shaffer’s *Amadeus* takes us on a wild ride through the trials and tribulations of genius, jealousy and revenge.

*Amadeus* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 23 November-3 December 2022. 

**Special offer:** book tickets for *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*, *Carrie: The Musical* and *Amadeus* simultaneously and receive 10% off. Discount will be automatically applied at the box office when booking all three shows in one transaction.
