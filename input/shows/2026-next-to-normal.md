***Next to Normal* is an intimate, modern exploration of family and illness, loss and grief. At its heart is Diana Goodman, a suburban wife and mother, haunted by her past and trying to make sense of her present.**

With a thrilling rock score, this powerful, Tony Award-winning musical invites us to look more closely at what a family hides between closed doors, allowing us to witness private lives from just beyond the threshold. 

Reviews of *Next to Normal* on Broadway said:

"It is much more than a feel-good musical; it is a feel everything musical. A brave, breathtaking musical!"\
*The New York Times*

“It’s the best musical of the season by a mile, an emotional powerhouse with a fire in its soul and a wicked wit that burns just as fiercely.”\
*Rolling Stone*

Director Jonny Harding-Cooper commented: "*Next to Normal* is the perfect blend of powerful storytelling, beautiful songs and rich characters. It’s potent, heart-wrenching and resists easy answers; it leans into the irrationality of human emotions and doesn’t shy away from how unpredictable that can be. What makes it extraordinary is the way it invites us to look closer at what a family hides behind closed doors, allowing us to witness private lives from just beyond the threshold. Our approach won’t be about echoing previous versions, but about building an environment where the cast can test, question and rediscover the work for themselves."
