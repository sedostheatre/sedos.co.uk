**Epic and yet intimate, *Titanic The Musical* captures the triumph and tragedy of the hopeful passengers on the ill-fated Ship of Dreams.**

In the final hours of 14 April 1912 the RMS Titanic, on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York, collided with an iceberg and sank. As “the unsinkable ship” went down, 1517 men, women and children lost their lives.

Based on real people, *Titanic The Musical* is a stunning and heart-breaking production focusing on the dreams and aspirations of the passengers, who boarded to take the trip of their lives, unaware that for many it would be their last journey. 

The Third Class immigrants dream of a better life in America, the Second Class imagine they too can join the lifestyles of the rich and famous, while the millionaire Barons of the First Class anticipate legacies lasting forever.

The original Broadway production won five Tony Awards including Best Musical, Best Score and Best Book.

*Titanic* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 23 November-2 December 2023.

This amateur production of *Titanic* is presented by arrangement with Concord Theatricals Ltd. on behalf of Tams-Witmark LLC. [www.concordtheatricals.co.uk](http://www.concordtheatricals.co.uk/)
