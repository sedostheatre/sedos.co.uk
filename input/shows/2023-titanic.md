      >A triumph. Somehow, Directors Louise Roberts and Rob Archibald have
      managed to move their 33 strong cast around this small space with great
      stagecraft and not a little ingenuity, making good use of an entrance
      created from an opening in the seating block… There are no weak
      performances here… It is a privilege to hear this score sung and played so
      well, and to see the piece produced so impressively in a small space.
      Highly recommended.

      >With a sprawling cast of over 30, crafting individual characters that strongly resonate is no easy feat. Yet, the talented ensemble manages the extraordinary, making you care deeply about characters, regardless of their social class and time spent on stage. The cast’s singing skills are absolutely astounding, mastering intricate harmonies and lightning-fast lyrics that elevate the musical score to remarkable heights… The talent on display is nothing short of insane… “Titanic: The Musical” is well-deservedly almost sold out for this run, but if you manage to book one of the tickets still left, there’s a possibility this may just become your new favourite musical. Don’t tell me I didn’t warn you!

      >So rarely seen in amateur productions, every member of this company is a skilled vocalist, with some performances that would not be out of place on a professional West End stage (and no, I do not say that lightly). What is most impressive is the rousing ensemble numbers – never missing a harmony, Ryan Macaulay’s musical direction brings out the very best in this talented troupe, actors and band alike.

      >Having seen Titanic The Musical several times before, I was keen to see how Sedos’ would create this production on a small stage and with a more modest budget than the current tour. But create and deliver they did. Congratulations to the entire company on an excellent production, both onstage and backstage, on producing a moving, stunning show of a legend.

**Epic and yet intimate, *Titanic The Musical* captures the triumph and tragedy of the hopeful passengers on the ill-fated Ship of Dreams.**

In the final hours of 14 April 1912 the RMS Titanic, on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York, collided with an iceberg and sank. As “the unsinkable ship” went down, 1517 men, women and children lost their lives.

Based on real people, *Titanic The Musical* is a stunning and heart-breaking production focusing on the dreams and aspirations of the passengers, who boarded to take the trip of their lives, unaware that for many it would be their last journey. 

The Third Class immigrants dream of a better life in America, the Second Class imagine they too can join the lifestyles of the rich and famous, while the millionaire Barons of the First Class anticipate legacies lasting forever.

The original Broadway production won five Tony Awards including Best Musical, Best Score and Best Book.

*Titanic* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 23 November-2 December 2023.

This amateur production of *Titanic* is presented by arrangement with Concord Theatricals Ltd. on behalf of Tams-Witmark LLC. [www.concordtheatricals.co.uk](http://www.concordtheatricals.co.uk/)

>A modern musical theatre masterpiece.
