**A﻿ unique collection of one-act plays exploring how deep the chasm or intense the claustrophobia could be inside your average family car.**

Each of these seven vignettes explore the ethos of perception and relationship – from a make-out session gone awry, to a kidnapping thinly disguised as a road trip, a reconnaissance mission involving the rescue of a Nintendo 64 to a daughter’s long ride home after her release from rehab.

*Autobahn* consists of seven short plays: *Funny; Bench Seat; All Apologies; Merge; Long Division; Road Trip* and *Autobahn.*

*Autobahn* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 17-21 September 2024.
