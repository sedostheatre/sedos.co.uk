#### **"A journey to the heart of fabulous!"**

**A colourful and vibrant spectacular featuring all-time dance and pop hits from the 80’s and 90’s, the story follows the adventure of three friends brought together under unique circumstances. Join them on their travels from the glamour and sparkle of Sydney as they ‘Go West’ into the heart of the Australian continent.**

Their journey through the desert introduces them to a variety of memorable characters and situations that only three drag queens could encounter. Technicolour outfits, sky-high heels and upbeat anthems entertain from start to finish, but relationships are at the very heart of this story which will keep you smiling, laughing – and singing along!

Based on the Oscar-winning 1994 hit movie, the critically-acclaimed stage musical version of*Priscilla*has played to packed houses all over the world during its journey over the past 10 years.

*Priscilla Queen of the Desert The Musical* was first presented at the Lyric Theatre, Sydney, on 7 October 2006, directed by Simon Phillips.
