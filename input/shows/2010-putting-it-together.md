**You are invited to join the celebrations at a cocktail party thrown in a chic New York penthouse. Watch as the evening unfolds and the guests reflect upon their romantic triumphs, financial failures and the darkness that hides under the glittering Manhattan moon.**

*Putting it Together* is a musical review devised by Stephen Sondheim and Julie McKenzie, drawing its title from a song in *Sunday in the Park with George*, with musical numbers from *Merrily We Roll Along*, *Into the Woods*, *Company*, *A Little Night Music* and *Follies*.

We're all incredibly excited about putting this together! We're taking a modern twist on the show, so think *Sex and the City* meets Sondheim with a splash of 1960s glamour.

Tucked away on the south side of the Thames between Vauxhall and Battersea, the Battersea Barge's intimacy, combined with a warm and relaxed atmosphere is the perfect setting for Sondheim's *Putting it Together*.

So come and enjoy top class performances and memorable music accompanied by dinner and cocktails - a truly unique summer evening on the Thames!
