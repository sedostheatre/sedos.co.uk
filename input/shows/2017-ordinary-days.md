>[Ordinary Days] captures with stinging clarity that uneasy moment in youth when doubts begin to cloud hopes for a future of unlimited possibility.

**From one of musical theatre's most exciting new composers comes *Ordinary Days*, a refreshingly honest and funny musical about making real connections in the city that never sleeps (but probably should at some point).**

*Ordinary Days* tells the story of four young New Yorkers whose lives intersect as they search for fulfillment, happiness, love and cabs. Through a score of vibrant and memorable songs, their experiences ring startlingly true to life.

*Ordinary Days* is an original musical for anyone who's ever struggled to appreciate the simple things in a complex place. With equal doses of humor and poignancy, it celebrates how 8.3 million individual stories combine in unexpected ways to make New York City such a unique and extraordinary home.

For *Ordinary Days*, Adam Gwon won the 2008 Fred Ebb Award for excellence in musical theatre songwriting and the 2011 Kleban Award in the Lyricist category.

**PLEASE NOTE**: *Ordinary Days* is being performed as part of a two show evening of theatre and will take place after performances of drama *[The Nether](/shows/2017-the-nether)*.
