**Someone in spymaster Hapgood’s agency is leaking secret research to Moscow. Hapgood is under pressure to expose the culprit.** 

She suspects there is a mole in her agency. CIA Agent Wates suspects Hapgood herself. Hapgood’s boss suspects Kerner (a brilliant Russian scientist who has defected to the West and is also a double agent - but is he a triple?). Will Hapgood’s elaborate scheme to expose the traitor be a success or is there more to it than meets the eye?

Originally starring Felicity Kendal, Nigel Hawthorne and Roger Rees, *Hapgood* has been described as “Ingenious” (Spectator) and “Dazzling” (Independent). Reviewing the play’s most recent professional outing in 2008 starring Josie Lawrence, The Guardian wrote: “Tom Stoppard’s most cunning play – a dazzling double game of physics and espionage – remarkable”.
