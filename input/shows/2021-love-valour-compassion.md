**Eight gay men.**

**Three long weekends.**

**One last summer.**

Winner of the 1995 Tony Award for Best Play, *Love! Valour! Compassion!* is a monumental exploration into life, love and loss at the end of the millennium.

As hilarious as it is heart-breaking, Terrence McNally’s seminal work captures the zeitgeist of 90s America and forces the question - when reality hits home, who and what is most important to us?

*Love! Valour! Compassion!* explores sensitive issues relating to gender, sexuality, race, religion, politics, disability and HIV status. This show contains nudity, strong language and racially offensive language. It was written, set and originally performed in the mid 90s and the text reflects the social and cultural context of the time. We would recommend that all audience members should be 16 years old or older. 

Haze, smoke, strobe lighting and loud noises may be used.

*Love! Valour! Compassion!* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 5-9 July 2022.
