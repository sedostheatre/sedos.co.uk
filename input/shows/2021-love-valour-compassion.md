**Eight gay men.**

**Three long weekends.**

**One last summer.**

Winner of the 1995 Tony Award for Best Play, *Love! Valour! Compassion!* is a monumental exploration into life, love and loss at the end of the millennium.

As hilarious as it is heart-breaking, Terrence McNally’s seminal work captures the zeitgeist of 90s America and forces the question - when reality hits home, who and what is most important to us?

*Love! Valour! Compassion!* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 5-9 July 2022.
