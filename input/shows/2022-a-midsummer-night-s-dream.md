metaDescription: A Midsummer Night’s Dream, part of Sedos’ 2022 London season,
  plays at the Bridewell Theatre from 14-24 September 2022 – a queer look at
  Shakespeare’s classic play
---
**A queer re-telling. Shakespeare meets gig theatre; dance, lip-sync battles, classic text, all fused into one riotous night of theatrical comedy.**

In this show we will have:

Classic Shakespeare \* Lesbian Lovers \* Acoustic modern folk performances \* Lady Gaga songs \* Commercial Dance \* Ballroom and Voguing \* Funky Dungaree Dressed Mechanicals \* Drag Kings \* Slapstick \* AFAB Queens \* Non-Binary Babes \* Lip-Sync Battles \* A show that is different every night \* An Emcee that holds it together \* and much more!

This show will be a chaotic delight that will hopefully explore all the edges of the characters, our performers and our audiences. It will not be a show for the faint-hearted, not from a physical energy perspective for all our company, but from the point of view of the capacity to think big, play big and push ourselves to play expansively.

Registration is now open for [A Midsummer Night’s Dream auditions](https://sedos.co.uk/events/a-midsummer-night-s-dream-workshop-and-auditions). 

This show contains adult content, and explores themes around sexuality.

*A Midsummer Night’s Dream* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 14-24 September 2022.

**Special offer:** book tickets for *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*, *Carrie: The Musical* and *Amadeus* simultaneously and receive 10% off. Discount will be automatically applied at the box office when booking all three shows in one transaction.
