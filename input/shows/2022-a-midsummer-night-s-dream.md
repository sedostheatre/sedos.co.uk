      **CREATIVE TEAM**


      **DIRECTOR** | Matt Hudson\

      **PRODUCER** | Clare Harding


      We are interested to hear from choreographers who have experience in commercial pop, and maybe voguing. Also, on the hunt for assistant directors from the LGBT+ community to come and get involved, no experience necessary. Please contact us on [midsummer@sedos.co.uk](mailto:midsummer@sedos.co.uk)\

      \

      We are also building out the technical creative team (LX, Sound and Staging) so get in touch on [midsummer@sedos.co.uk](mailto:midsummer@sedos.co.uk) if you are interested.
