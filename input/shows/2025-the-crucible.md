**"The Devil’s loose in Salem, Mister Proctor, we must discover where he’s hiding!”**

Blame and paranoia spread like wildfire. Whose reputations will survive the flames when the accusations start?

Miller’s 1952 classic explores the Salem Witch Trials, in 1692 Massachusetts. Teenager Abigail Williams leads a group of girls in accusing others in their tight-knit community of witchcraft. Hysteria erupts across Salem and innocent villagers pay the price. A farmer, John Proctor, is caught in an impossible dilemma, torn between his reputation and his life. 

This production of *The Crucible* will invite you into Salem and show you things the villagers don’t want you to see.

Director Jonah McLeod commented: "*The Crucible* is one of the greatest works of modern drama — we want to do it justice. Our vision is of a Salem that is so close up to the audience that horror is hidden in plain sight. We can’t wait to enter the unsettling world of 1692, and to be swept up in all the truth, lies, and everything in between."
