**Written by one of the finest teams ever assembled for a musical show, *West Side Story* transports a timeless, classic love story to the raw urban streets of New York City where war is raging between the Jets and the Sharks. With a score consisting of some of theatre’s most memorable and moving numbers, the show provides the chance to sing, dance and act your hearts out in what is understandably one of history’s most treasured and popular theatrical masterpieces.**

Set in New York City in the mid-1950s, the musical explores the rivalry between the Jets and the Sharks, two teenage street gangs of different ethnic backgrounds. The members of the Sharks from Puerto Rico are taunted by the Jets, a working-class white group. The young protagonist, Tony, one of the Jets, falls in love with Maria, the sister of Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks. A weave of conflict, prejudice, split loyalties and tragedy ensues.
