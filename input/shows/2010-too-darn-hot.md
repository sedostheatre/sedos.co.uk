**Building on success of 2008’s *Red Hot & Black*** **we thought it was time to put on another cabaret. *Too Darn Hot* takes its inspiration from the black and white movies of the late 50s and early 60s.**

Throw together girls in torpedo bras and 'wiggle' skirts, add guys in skinny suits, plus an evocative score, and you get an exciting musical revue. Filled with songs from the period, some well-known film and musical scores and a smattering of modern pop, *Too Darn Hot* has that original 'edge’.

Follow the journey of naive Anna who, on hearing that a new movie will premiere in her home city, is determined to meet the director. Along the way she encounters a dazzling array of people and hears about their stories of romance, betrayal, desire and mystery. These encounters are told through song and dance, with choreography inspired by Bob Fosse. This vibrant and exciting show promises to get your toes tapping, and you may even find yourself singing along!

For two nights only (1 October 10pm, 2 October 7.30pmt) the cabaret will feature those deliciously naughty showgirls - The Dolly Mixtures! To top it off you'll also get a free glass of fizz and a late bar!

I look forward to seeing you there

Angus Jacobs

Creative Director
