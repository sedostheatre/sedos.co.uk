Winner of the 1995 Tony Award for Best Play, *Love! Valour! Compassion!* is a monumental exploration into life, love and loss at the end of the millennium.

As hilarious as it is heart-breaking, Terrence McNally's seminal work captures the zeitgeist of 90s America and forces the question - when reality hits home, who and what is most important to us?

We are looking for a diverse group of seven strong character actors to stage this seldom performed piece. [See auditions information here.](https://sedos.l3v5y.co.uk/events/love-valour-compassion-auditions) 

*This amateur production is presented by arrangement with Josef Weinberger Ltd.*
