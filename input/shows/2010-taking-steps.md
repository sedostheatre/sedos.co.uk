***Taking Steps* is a farce by popular English dramatist Alan Ayckbourn. It starts with a 'Dear John' letter that falls into the wrong hands, progresses through a romance with a ghost and a girl locked in a cupboard with a gurgling water tank, and involves the challenge of putting a three-storey house into the Bridewell Theatre.**

Dancer Elizabeth thinks she’s taking steps towards leaving her husband, Roland. Roland thinks he’s taking steps towards buying a house to live in with her. Elizabeth’s brother, Mark, thinks he’s taking steps towards getting back together with his former fiancée, Kitty. Kitty doesn’t know which way to step at all.

When a 'Dear John' letter falls into the wrong hands and one of the main players gets locked in a cupboard for the night, no one’s taking quite the steps they intended.
