## ***Sink the Belgrano!***

**A political satire based on the events and personalities of the Falklands conflict with dark undertones.**

As Maggot Scratcher debates with her Downing Street lackeys Pimp and Nit, a supporting cast of submariners, Falklands residents, ministry hats and the President of Argentina describe and disseminate the events of 1982. Beautifully irreverent, the play is a must see for all interested in political intrigue and modern history.

> >It had to be written. What a story! All those statements and contradictions in the House of Commons. All those statesmen lying their heads off in the Commons

## ***Man of Destiny***

**An investigation of a young twenty-seven year old general by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte who has yet to achieve the accomplishments for which make him such an important figure in world history.**

In the play we find him waiting impatiently at an inn on the road between Lodi and Milan for a packet of dispatches to arrive, in which he will discover the truth of a personal betrayal.

With rich dialogue and dramatic style Shaw delivers within this short little work a satisfying character study and a portrait of the everyday life of a great man prior to his greatness.
