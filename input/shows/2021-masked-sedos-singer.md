**Disguised Sedos members go head to head in the Masked Sedos Singer – can you guess who is in the costume?**

Our judges will plunder their Sedos knowledge to try to work out the identity of our performers and you can get involved too. 

There will be two heats on Tuesday 16 and Wednesday 17 February leading up to a grand final on Tuesday 9 March. 

Ultimately, it's the audience's decision who makes it through to the final – and who is crowned the winner – so get ready to vote for your favourite.
