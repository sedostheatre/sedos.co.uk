AT THE DAWN OF A NEW CENTURY, EVERYTHING IS CHANGING AND ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE

Ragtime is a sweeping epic musical about the birth of America that weaves together real celebrities and historical events with a timeless tale of three families in pursuit of the American Dream.

Set in the melting pot of New York, the stories of a stifled upper-class wife, a determined Jewish immigrant and a daring young Harlem musician are intertwined, united by their desire and belief in a brighter tomorrow. Together, they confront historyâ€™s timeless contradictions of wealth and poverty, freedom and prejudice, hope and despair - and what it means to live in America.

A multi award-winning masterpiece from Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty, with a book by Terrence McNally, Ragtime is a compelling story of courage, love and hope.
