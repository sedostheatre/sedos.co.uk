      >Many groups would not be able to cast this show, let alone put it on
      stage, but Sedos can do so and with verve and invention in Matt Gould’s
      pacy and intelligent production, managing his cast of 32 well and ensuring
      that the complex storyline is at all times as clear as possible. MD Ryan
      Macaulay conducts an 18-piece orchestra and it is a delight to hear this
      score played so well and in these orchestrations. Choreography from
      Victoria Louise-Currie and Rachel Elfassy-Bitoun is nicely differentiated
      for the various groups and makes good use of the multi-layered set.

      >There is too much good about this production to sum it all up in one short review but if you are a fan of the bombastic in musical theatre.*Ragtime*is a must see and you never know when you might have the opportunity again with such a rarely performed work. Sedos have bravely taken a risk on this one and it has paid off in spades. An accomplished piece of theatre executed by an accomplished group of peoples whose love of the art shines through in everything they do.

      >An orchestra of eighteen and a cast of thirty-two is impressive for the West End these days, let alone amateur dramatics. The production team is worth a mention as well, for several reasons… It is difficult to balance out the sound with a cast and an orchestra as large as this, but the techies here do a remarkable job, with not a single lyric or line of spoken dialogue missed thanks to each and every microphone functioning as it should throughout.

**At the dawn of the new century, everything is changing and anything is possible.**

*Ragtime* is a sweeping epic musical about the birth of America that weaves together real celebrities and historical events with a timeless tale of three families in pursuit of the American Dream.

Set in the melting pot of New York, the stories of a stifled upper-class wife, a determined Jewish immigrant and a daring young Harlem musician are intertwined, united by their desire and belief in a brighter tomorrow. Together, they confront history’s timeless contradictions of wealth and poverty, freedom and prejudice, hope and despair - and what it means to live in America.

A multi award-winning masterpiece from Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty, with a book by Terrence McNally, *Ragtime* is a compelling story of courage, love and hope.
