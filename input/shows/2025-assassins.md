**“Murder is a tawdry little crime. But when a president gets killed… he gets assassinated.”**

Welcome to Americon – a twisted convention of history’s most notorious names. From John Wilkes Booth to Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassins who killed – or tried to kill – America’s presidents gather in one surreal, darkly comic musical to take their shot at infamy.

Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman’s *Assassins* is a bold, satirical, fiercely funny journey through the dark side of the American dream, exploring the fractured psyche of a nation obsessed with power, celebrity and the myth of the self-made man. 

In this nightmarish roller coaster, assassins from across the ages meet and inspire each other to harrowing acts. Time bends, motives collide and forgotten voices demand to be heard – by any means necessary.

A multiple award-winning theatrical tour-de-force, *Assassins* brings Sondheim's signature blend of intelligent lyrics and beautiful music to this timely reimagining of one of the most controversial musicals ever written.

Take your seat. Take your shot.

*Assassins* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sbf.org.uk/venue-hire/bridewell-theatre/) from 23-27 September 2024.
