**"Everybody has the right to their dreams.”**

A timely reimagining of Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman's musical that explores the darkness in those that the American Dream leaves behind.

*Assassins* tells the stories of nine individuals who either attempted to or succeeded in assassinating Presidents of the United States. The show explores the concept of the American Dream, or rather the dark side of that Dream – that quick fame is the objective and one of the quickest routes to that, try to kill a President. 

Our production will reimagine *Assassins* in a modern setting and show that, despite being 30 years old, the themes and lessons are still incredibly relevant today.

*Assassins* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 17-21 September 2024.

**Content warnings:** Scenes of violence and death, guns (both physically in the show but also gunshots, flashing lights etc).

**Assassins**
Music and Lyrics by Stephen Sondheim 
Book by John Weidman

*Assassins* is based on an idea by Charles Gilbert, Jr.
