      >Dan Edge is the director of Sedos’ production and his concept was
      brilliantly considered… Each moment is played out perfectly in this new
      setting and… the ending is the icing on the cake… I am a big fan of shows
      being reinvented in new and relevant ways for a modern audience and Sedos
      has given us an exemplary display of how it should be done

      >Sedos’ Assassins is a polished, provocative production that deserves a life beyond its short run. It’s daring, darkly funny, and uncomfortably timely. Sondheim’s biting score and sharp lyrics are brought to life by a cast of remarkable vocal talent. If any fringe production has earned a shot at the West End spotlight, it’s this one. Bravo indeed!

      >I would strongly recommend following Sedos as quite possibly London’s finest amateur theatre company. Well done to the creative team behind the show for putting on a brilliant performance.

      >Assassins has never been more relevant. This may be an amateur production, but Sedos know their Sondheim and have pulled out all the stops.

      >When Sedos do Sondheim, you know it’s going to be special, and this energetic production of Assassins hits the mark with style… Dan Edge’s skilful direction creates a fantastic, heightened energy dynamic for this glorious parody of desperation and political violence, and Adrian Jeakins production design is wonderfully brash… Another triumph for the talented team at Sedos

**“Murder is a tawdry little crime. But when a president gets killed… he gets assassinated.”**

Welcome to Americon – a twisted convention of history’s most notorious names. From John Wilkes Booth to Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassins who killed – or tried to kill – America’s presidents gather in one surreal, darkly comic musical to take their shot at infamy.

Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman’s *Assassins* is a bold, satirical, fiercely funny journey through the dark side of the American dream, exploring the fractured psyche of a nation obsessed with power, celebrity and the myth of the self-made man. 

In this nightmarish roller coaster, assassins from across the ages meet and inspire each other to harrowing acts. Time bends, motives collide and forgotten voices demand to be heard – by any means necessary.

A multiple award-winning theatrical tour-de-force, *Assassins* brings Sondheim's signature blend of intelligent lyrics and beautiful music to this timely reimagining of one of the most controversial musicals ever written.

Take your seat. Take your shot.

*Assassins* plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sbf.org.uk/venue-hire/bridewell-theatre/) from 23-27 September 2024.

**Every performance of *Assassins* is now sold out – please check the [box office](https://sedos.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/1173660211) for returns.**
