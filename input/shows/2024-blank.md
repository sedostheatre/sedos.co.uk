**“This play is a challenge and an invitation to you and your company to make your own play”**

Alice Birch wrote 100 scenes, for both adults and children, that can be repeated, put in any order and presented however the company likes, so the possibilities for this show are endless. No two productions will ever be the same.\
\
The play looks at the experience of women in prison as well as the impact incarceration has on their families. We see how the prison system affects those incarcerated, those who work within it and those who are left behind. The play certainly goes to some dark places but it would be wrong to see Alice Birch’s work as just a howl of rage, as she says, “I think kindness is really what I’m writing about all the time.”
