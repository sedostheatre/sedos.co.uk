### London plays, London musicals – and beyond

Sedos is a [London amateur theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/) company which produces five to 10 shows every year. We have been resident at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) (just off Fleet Street) since 2012 and most of our London musicals and plays take place there.

The society aims to programme a wide range of London plays and musicals, presenting new twists on old classics as well as staging new work and rarely-performed pieces. We also sometimes put on cabarets, dance shows and improv, and we have in the past collaborated with other London societies on joint projects.

Sedos is an amateur company, but strives for professional standards in all its shows.

The society has 10 weeks every year at the 130-seat Bridewell Theatre and a typical Sedos season will consist of two two-week musicals (one in the spring and one shortly before Christmas) which have 11 performances, at least one one-week musical and at least three one-week plays, which run for six performances. But there is variation in this pattern as the needs of the season dictate – we have previously run London plays for two weeks when the title’s complexity and popularity demands it.  Sometimes we perform in London venues other than the Bridewell, too.

We usually programme a whole year’s season together, calling out for pitches in the summer and revealing the following year’s shows in early autumn.

As well as our London musicals and plays, we occasionally tour outside the city.

In the past we have staged shows at the Edinburgh Fringe, including a sell-out run for our in-house improv troupe [the Banana Hut Gang](https://sedos.co.uk/regular-events/simprov).

In 2019 Sedos staged [its first show at Cornwall's beautiful outdoor theatre, the Minack,](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2019-a-swell-party) and we hope very much to return there in the future.

Sedos holds free, open auditions for all its shows (£10 reservation fee for non-members, refunded if you attend the audition or give 72 hours notice of cancellation) – find out about our [London auditions](https://sedos.co.uk/get-involved).
