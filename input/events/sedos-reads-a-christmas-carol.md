Arguably Charles Dickens most famous novel, and certainly one of the best known Christmas stories, this lively theatrical adaptation is by director Peter Foster following the success of *[The Miller and his Men](https://sedos.co.uk/news/2020-11-05-the-miller-and-his-men-cast-announced)*. \
\
To take part in this specially adapted and rehearsed reading of *A Christmas Carol*, if you haven't read with us before, please complete the form at [https://forms.gle/​6Cvme3kCGerAU9w36](https://forms.gle/6Cvme3kCGerAU9w36) and send us a short filmed monologue (maximum of 2 minutes) via WeTransfer to [readings@sedos.co.uk](readings@sedos.co.uk). The monologue isn't compulsory, but really does help us when it comes to casting if we haven't seen you act before.

If you have read with us before and would like to take part in this reading, please email us to let us know and we will add you to the mix. 

Please ensure that all applications reach us by 6pm on Saturday 28 November. Although we can't cast everyone in every reading, we will try to ensure everyone gets a fair turn. \
\
If you are cast, you will be emailed a copy of the script, together with the cast list, on Sunday 29 November. There will be rehearsals on Thursday 3 and Tuesday 8 December with the performance on Thursday 10 December, all at 7.30pm.

If you would like to be part of our audience for *A Christmas Carol*, we have up to 85 slots, available on a first come, first served basis. Book early to avoid disappointment! Email [christmas_carol@sedos.co.uk](mailto:christmas_carol@sedos.co.uk) to request a spot.
