**Join us on Sunday 30 June at Regent's Park, from 1-4pm, for a picnic with Sedos!** 

All are welcome - newbies, members, casts, crews, friends and family. Bring your own picnic to chill and chat over snacks and drinks, speak with committee members and maybe even find a team to pitch a show with for 2025. 

No registration needed, just turn up. We hope to see you there!
