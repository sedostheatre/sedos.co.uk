Information has now been released about *[Sondheim on Sondheim](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2023-sondheim-on-sondheim)* auditions.

**ABOUT THE SHOW**

Hailed as a "revelatory revue full of wonderful moments" and a "funny, affectionate and revealing tribute to musical theatre’s greatest living composer and lyricist", Sondheim on Sondheim is an intimate portrait of the famed songwriter in his own words and music. Through the use of exclusive interview footage, audiences get an inside look at the personal life and artistic process of famed composer, Stephen Sondheim.

His story. His inspiration. His genius. The tapestry of creativity that characterises Stephen Sondheim remained largely undiscussed, especially by the man himself, until the creation of *Sondheim on Sondheim*. Ranging from the beloved to the obscure, the carefully selected two-dozen songs hang from a framework of in-depth video interviews, delving into Sondheim’s personal life and artistic process.

Far from the typical song cycle, *Sondheim on Sondheim* has massive theatrical potency, as well as inarguable staying power. The incomparable James Lapine brilliantly curated a collection of songs that have been masterfully arranged by David Loud.

**CONCEPT**

This show has an extra special connection with the [Bridewell Theatre](https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell). The original production that *Sondheim on Sondheim* was based on, *Moving on* (David Kernan), was originally produced and performed at the Bridewell Theatre in 2000 and we are honoured to be bringing this show back to the Bridewell in it’s newest incarnation for the first time since its original inception.   

As a team, we’re very excited to be presenting a collection of Sondeim’s greatest works to life following his death in 2021. And we really do mean to bring a huge amount of life to this show being, what is essentially, a Hall of Fame for his work.

Our aim is to place the focus of the music and performances themselves. The set will be simple and stylish, split across a number of platform levels on the stage to facilitate the transition from song to song. Costumes will be kept simple and props will be minimal. Rehearsal time will be spent almost exclusively on helping the cast to produce the best performances possible. We are looking to create a slick and professional revue that will appeal to Sondheim superfans as a great example of his work but also present an enjoyable and accessible theatre experience for those less familiar with Sondheim’s work.

**KEY DATES**

**Workshop:** Sunday 5 March \
**Self-tape first round auditions:** submission deadline 16 March\
**In-person recalls:** Sunday 2 April

**ROLES**

*Sondheim on Sondheim* isn’t a typical show with characters or a story. It’s a revue of Sondheim’s existing work and in the libretto “characters” are referred to as the name of the actor that originally performed it. 

Our intention is to replicate the traditional casting of eight core performers with an additional cast of four ensemble members making a total cast of 12. We intend to cast a mixture of genders. Casting will primarily be based on voice type and we are looking for a range of ages. There is a large quantity of numbers in the show so everyone will be kept very busy!

**[DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION](https://www.sedos.co.uk/about/diversity-and-inclusion) IN CASTING**

We are committed to ensuring *Sondheim on Sondheim*, and Sedos activities generally, are equally accessible to any person irrespective of race, colour, creed, ethnic or national origin, disability, religious belief, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, or class/socio-economic group. This is especially true of *Sondheim on Sondheim* where the only consideration in casting is whether an auditionee is able to learn and perform the music required for the show and demonstrates they are willing to work hard to support and cooperate with the overall team.
