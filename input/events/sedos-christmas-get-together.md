**LET'S GET CHRISTMAS STARTED**

Celebrate the end of lockdown 2.0 with quiz master extraordinaire James Franey, who returns to our small screens on Tuesday 1 December with a festive night of fun and games. 

Christmas sparkles, jumpers, hats and general festive attire encouraged and yes, there might be a mini-sing along! Plus, who knows, we might get set free at midnight. 

More info coming soon, but start gathering your teams of six.
