**Let's get Christmas started**

Celebrate the end of lockdown 2.0 with quiz master extraordinaire James Franey, who returns to our small screens on Tuesday 1 December with a festive night of fun and games. 

Christmas sparkles, jumpers, hats and general festive attire encouraged and yes, there might be a mini-sing along! Plus, who knows, we might get set free at midnight. 

**What do you need to do to join in with the festivities?**

Gather your team of six (virtually, of course). The team leader needs to submit the team name to [events@sedos.co.uk](mailto:events@sedos.co.uk) by 5pm on Saturday 28 November.  

The team leader will then receive the zoom link and joining instructions for their team on Sunday 29 November. Teams will be placed in zoom breakout rooms during the quiz so you can compare notes.

Don’t have a team lined up? If you would like to join in the fun and are happy to be put in a team with other Sedos quizzers, please email [](mailto:events@sedos.co.uk)[events@sedos.co.uk](mailto:events@sedos.co.uk) and we’ll bring you together with some other fun people.
