Registration is now open for *[Amadeus](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-amadeus)* auditions.

**ABOUT THE SHOW**

In the court of the Austrian Emperor Joseph II, Antonio Salieri is the celebrated and established composer. Enter one of the greatest musical geniuses of all time: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The Viennese court doesn’t recognise Mozart’s genius – “too many notes” – but Salieri does. Salieri is tortured by what he hears and suddenly becomes aware of his own mediocrity. He sets out to destroy the man he sees as God’s instrument on earth.

This multi-award winning play is a rich, exuberant portrayal of a God-like man among mortals; and lives destroyed by envy – all to the backing track of Mozart’s glorious music. While the backing track will be pre-recorded, we are looking for two performers to perform operatic arias live (one female and one male).

We will be creating a timeless production; influenced by the historic period, but with modern twists and sensibilities. We want to lift the piece out of its historic period and find a way of connecting with audiences and telling the story in as engaging a way as possible. The costumes will be magnificent and entertaining; and the set will be fun and versatile. This won’t be a staid or traditional production! Oh - and it is of course fiction!

**CASTING | DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION**\
\
Sedos is committed to diversity and inclusion. Our commitment is to build and sustain a membership that is reflective of the diverse communities within London. We actively encourage all performers to audition for the roles which they feel best suit their skills.

In the original production of *Amadeus*, the majority of the cast were white and male. We are seeking a diverse cast for our production with many different experiences brought to the rehearsal room and the performance.

Given the nature of the text and the historical nature of the play, we will be looking for performers who identify as male to play Salieri and Mozart and as female for Constanze. We are intending to alter the gender of other roles and these are detailed in the character list below.

For the eight named roles, we will be aiming to cast as age-appropriately as possible and age ranges are given in the cast breakdown below.

For the Venticelli and ensemble, we will be looking for a range of ages, and to divide equally male and female, and we are open to including trans-gender and non-binary performers. We may adjust the balance depending on who auditions.

We have no preconceived ideas as to the ethnicity of any role and ethnicity will not be a factor in any casting choice.

We will consider performers with a disability for any role and would actively encourage disabled performers to audition. If you would like to discuss further, including how the audition process might work and practicalities in the rehearsal or performance, please do get in touch.
