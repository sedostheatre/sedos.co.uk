Scripts (which you do not need to learn!) will be issued online to cast members on Sunday 18 July, and there will be an online meeting and read through prior to the live rehearsal and performance day. The play runs approximately one hour. 

The range of roles encompasses age and sex, and as with [Sedos Reads](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2020-lets-talk-about-scripts), our online performance season during lockdown, casting is completely open to all. We are looking for a cast of up to 16. Casting is not by audition but you do need to apply!
