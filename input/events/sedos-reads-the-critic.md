***The Critic* was first staged at Drury Lane Theatre in 1779. Sheridan’s comedy is a burlesque on acting, play production, and a parody of tragic drama conventions. Misadventures arise when the playwright, Puff, invites theatre critics Dangle and Sneer to a rehearsal of his play The Spanish Armada.**

Sheridan wrote his first play, *The Rivals*, in 1775, to huge success. In 1777 he wrote *A School For Scandal* and followed it with *The Critic* in 1779. From 1780 he abandoned writing and became a controversial figure as an MP advocating press freedom, and later well-known as the owner of the Drury Lane theatre.

The performance of *The Critic* (lasting approximately an hour) is on Thursday 18 February at 7.30pm. Email [audience@sedos.co.uk ](mailto:audience@sedos.co.uk)to watch the show.
