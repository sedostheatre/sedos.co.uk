**Sedos are proud to announce the second *Play in a Day* event for 2021, *DNA* by Dennis Kelly, which forms part of our September Festival (19-25 September 2021). We'll be rehearsing and performing Kelly’s moral tug of war between actions and their consequences in a single day on Saturday 25 September 2021.**
