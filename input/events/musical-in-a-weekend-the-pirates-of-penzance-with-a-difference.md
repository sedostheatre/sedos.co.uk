**About Musical in a Weekend**

The main aim of this weekend is to have fun! It’s a chance to pack all the highs of doing a show into a 48-hour period and to give an opportunity to perform to people who might not usually be able to commit to a rehearsal period due to other commitments. After  acouple of days of rehearsal, there will be a relaxed performance, in the style of a rehearsed reading. 

The show will be Esgee Production’s *The Pirates of Penzance*. This updated version of a Gilbert and Sullivan classic puts a modern twist on a much-loved classic - it even includes a megamix!

**When is it?**

The weekend commences with a welcome from 6.30pm on Friday 17 September before rehearsal (and auditions for named roles) at 7pm until 9.30pm (approx). 

We will then run from 9am-6.30pm on Saturday 19 September and from 9am-3pm on Sunday 20 September (prompt start at 9am both days, with the building open for arriving from 8.30am). 

We are aware that some people won’t be able to commit to the full weekend, so we will be expanding the ensemble with an “On The Day Choir”.

**Do I have to audition to take part?**

The named roles will be auditioned on the Friday night whilst the ensemble rehearsal will be taking place – [more info in the audition notice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GW2j1YMh7Je020u5-C2mPTpjO33t_12LFcErs0ZVQ3o/edit?usp=sharing). Participation in the ensemble and “On The Day Choir” is open to everyone with no auditions. 

**Casting**

Sedos seeks to build and sustain a membership that is reflective of the diverse communities within London. We actively encourage all performers of all ethnicity and genders to participate and audition for the roles which best suit their skills.  

 We will be delighted to audition and cast actors of any ethnicity, gender and age for all roles in this production. For example, Ruth could portrayed by a man as a panto dame; Frederic and the Pirate King by women; the Major General’s daughters by men.  We welcome non-binary portrayals.  

 All members of the Ensemble will have the opportunity to perform in daughters / pirates / police songs regardless of gender, whether it be singing or other performance opportunities.
