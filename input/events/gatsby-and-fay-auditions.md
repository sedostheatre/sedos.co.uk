**ABOUT THE SHOW**

*Gatsby and Fay* is a radical queer retelling of *The Great Gatsby* that’s grimmer, glammer, and gayer than ever. Jay Gatsby is the enigmatic trans host of London’s most outrageously queer parties. They’re desperate to win back their bisexual ex girlfriend, Daisy Fay Buchanan, five years after transphobia drove them apart. But her abusive husband isn’t going to let her go.

This play is a celebration of queer growth full of laughter, tears, and a personal look at abuse.

Gatsby and Fay is about love. How we idealise our loved ones, how we make excuses for a lover’s bad behaviour, how we value certain types of love over others. And above all, Gatsby and Fay is about what happens when love goes wrong.

**DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN CASTING**

We are committed to ensuring *Gatsby and Fay*, and Sedos activities generally, are equally accessible to any person irrespective of race, colour, creed, ethnic or national origin, disability, religious belief, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, or class/socio-economic group. This is especially true of *Gatsby and Fay*, which is a show that’s designed to flip old conceptions of Gatsby on their heads and express the reality of the queer community. Gatsby’s parties are queer parties, and modern queer culture was created and continues to be enhanced by Black and Indigenous, disabled, and trans queer people. We are looking to cast this show consciously and inclusively.
