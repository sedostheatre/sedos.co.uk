**Announcing new [London auditions](https://sedos.co.uk/get-involved)! Registration is now open for auditions for our production of *[Love! Valour! Compassion!](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-love-valour-compassion)* (performances 5-9 July at the Bridewell Theatre).**

Eight gay men.
Three long weekends.
One last summer.

Winner of the 1995 Tony Award for Best Play, *Love! Valour! Compassion!* is a monumental exploration into life, love and loss at the end of the millennium.

As hilarious as it is heart-breaking, Terence McNally’s seminal work captures the zeitgeist of 90s America and forces the question - when reality hits home, who and what is most important to us?
