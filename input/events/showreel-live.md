**Come and join us as we grace the stage at the Phoenix Arts Club for their weekly Showreel Live! musical theatre open mic night!** 

We've managed to secure a Sedos group booking on **Tuesday 20 June at 7PM**. Spaces are limited and our friends at the Phoenix Arts Club have offered us priority singing slots on the night where you'll be accompanied by a West End musical director on piano. Sheet music will be requested in advance once you've confirmed your ticket. 

Even if you prefer not to sing, why not come along and cheer your friends smashing out some Sondheim, Schwartz or Schönberg and catch up over a drink? The whole evening is also streamed live so that even Mum and Dad can watch you sing 'on a West End stage'
