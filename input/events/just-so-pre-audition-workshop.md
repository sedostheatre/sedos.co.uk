**ABOUT THE SHOW**

Based on the *Just So Stories* by Rudyard Kipling comes a British musical by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe. The original stories by Kipling tell of how the animals we know today acquired their unique traits. *Just So* the musical draws upon the original writing to tell the story of the Elephant’s Child, on a journey of self-discovery, in search of Pau Amma the great Crab that floods the plains. On the way he meets animals in the jungle, on the plains, on a seemingly uninhabited island, and by the great grey green Limpopo River.

The workshop is an opportunity to meet the creative team and learn more about *Just S*o, as well as ask any questions. \
\
The team will talk about their vision for the production, before a chance to sing through a number from the show with our musical director to get a feel for the music. Our choreographer will also teach the audition movement, so come along for a little bop!\
\
The movement isn’t too strenuous but we would recommend shoes and clothing that you are comfortable dancing in.

You don’t need to prepare anything for the workshop and it is free to attend. Attendance is not compulsory and will not affect your chances of being cast.\
\
We’ll be opening our audition bookings after the workshop so you haven’t missed that boat!
