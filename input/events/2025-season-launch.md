This is your opportunity to hear about our 2025 season before anyone else, so if you want to be the first in the know then make sure you come down and join us!

This event is FREE and is open to Sedos members and non-members alike! 

Whether you're looking to get involved in your first or 50th Sedos show, or want to join our amazing community of passionate amateur theatre-makers, this will be a great way to meet other Sedos members, find out about how to take part, and potentially get involved on a production team (if that's your thing!).
