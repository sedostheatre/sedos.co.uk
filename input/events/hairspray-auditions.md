**INTRODUCTION TO THE SHOW**

“You gotta think big to be big!”

*Hairspray* is the big, bold and beautiful musical you’ve been waiting for!

Set in 1960s Baltimore, with a bumping rhythm and blues score by Marc Whitman, this show has had audiences around the world dancing to hits like 'Run and Tell That', 'Without Love' and 'You Can’t Stop the Beat' since the show’s release in 2002.

Tracey Turnblad is ready to dance her way to success and change the world along the way. When she’s cast on local TV’s Corny Collins Show, Tracey calls for integration and equality and won’t stop until everyone can dance together, no matter what they look like or where they come from.

**WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR**

We’ll be casting 25-30 performers to bring *Hairspray* to life. With a mix of principal roles, featured roles, and ensemble roles, with varying levels of singing and dancing required, there’s something for everyone!

See the [audition notice](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aHu2QhRjtSrqWYDMnF0F7l_35PmIk6Z-) for the full casting breakdown.

**DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN CASTING**

Sedos strives to ensure our activities are equally accessible to any person irrespective of race, colour, creed, ethnic or national origin, disability, religious belief, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, or class/socio-economic group. We are also committed to authentic storytelling and ensuring that those roles which require specific casting are cast appropriately.

Given the themes and narrative of the show, there are certain characters that will need to be cast as specific ethnicities. We have outlined this in each character description in the audition notice where relevant. We are open to diverse casting where a specific ethnicity is not required or specified, and actively encourage performers to audition for the roles which best suit their skills.

If you have any questions about auditions or you’re unsure which role might suit you best, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at [hairspray@sedos.co.uk](mailto:hairspray@sedos.co.uk)

You can read Sedos’s [Equality, Diversity and Inclusion policy in full here](https://www.sedos.co.uk/assets/policies/2023-12-edi-policy.pdf).

**WORKSHOP** 

**When:** Tuesday 14 January, 7pm and 8.30pm\
**Where:** Vibast Community Centre, 167 Old Street, EC1V 9NH\
**Sign up:** [here](https://membership.sedos.co.uk/signup/134)

Update on 7 December: both *Hairspray* workshops are now full, thanks to everyone who signed up! We’re not running a waitlist, but please [check the sign-up portal](https://membership.sedos.co.uk/signup/134) periodically to see if there have been any cancellations. Don’t worry if you can’t get in – it is not compulsory to attend the workshop to audition and you can still send in an audition self-tape without attending the workshop.

Still not sure about auditioning? Do you want to find out more about our vision for the show or do you want to find out more about Sedos?

We’ll be running a workshop where we’ll sing through a musical number from the show together, and leave plenty of time for you to ask questions about the auditions. Workshops are a really good way to find out about Sedos and meet others who have done shows before, people who are new to the scene and to speak to the team on a very informal basis. Attending the workshop isn’t mandatory for auditions and won't have any effect on the casting process.

[Sign up for the workshop](https://membership.sedos.co.uk/signup/134)

**WHAT DO TO NOW**

Read the full audition notice for details of how to submit your self-tape.
