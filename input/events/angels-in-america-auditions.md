**ABOUT SEDOS’S ANGELS IN AMERICA**

As part of this unique and extraordinary experience, Sedos is presenting *Angels in America* in its entirety – giving actors the rare chance to perform in both parts in rep and audiences to experience the complete epic journey. Two parts. Same actors. Same creative team. An unparalleled experience for the creative team, actors, and audiences.

Staging such a monumentally iconic piece of theatre in an incredibly intimate space like the Bridewell Theatre will bring *Angels in America* face to face with our audience – physically and emotionally. This allows for a much more personal theatrical experience than is often seen in other larger-scale productions of Angels in America, as the emotional impact of the stories and the connections of its characters will be palpable from just a few feet away.

Our *Angels in America* embraces the 1980s setting of the play, while exploring theatrical conventions that bring to life the dramatically changing scenes, the alternate universes, and the emotional roller- coaster of our characters. A world that juxtaposes sterile and clinical expectations with the gritty realities of living during the height of AIDS. A world with more parallels to today than one might imagine. 

Our set, like the world of our characters, is a work-in-progress, with literal fragments and pieces in constant motion. And our soundscape of live musicians will tap into the nostalgic hearts of our audiences, while heightening emotional moments for our actors.

Most importantly, *Angels in America* allows us to embrace a gay and queer history and culture that is so often hidden from the theatrical spotlight. For our actors, creative team, society, and audiences, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be a part of a culturally-significant piece of theatrical history.

**DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION**

Across the entire cast there are opportunities for actors of all ages, ethnicities and genders to be cast. Our primary consideration during the audition process is to witness the actorʼs authenticity and their understanding of the text in relation to the thematic content and cultural references. 

Tony Kushnerʼs ingenious writing gives us some flexibility in casting, but the complexity and intricacies of his characters means there are many factors to consider during casting. 

As such, all roles except Roy and Belize (more info in role profiles in [full audition notice](<LINK TO FULL AUDITION NOTICE>)) are open to actors of any race, and some casting decisions may be made based on character connections and relationships within the play. 

Playing age and gender presentation requirements for all roles are detailed in the breakdown at the bottom of the notice.

Sedos is committed to diversity and inclusion. Our commitment is to build and sustain a membership that is reflective of the diverse communities within London. We actively encourage all performers to audition for the roles which they feel best suit their skills.
