**ABOUT THE SHOW**

Hedda has a comfortable life. Newly wedded to an up-and-coming academic, a penthouse apartment, financial freedom, and the envy of her peers. But beneath it all, she is left suppressed, reduced to an appendage, railing against the suffocating domesticity of her new life. Desperate for what she doesn’t have – volatility and control.

When a former lover returns, Hedda finds herself sliding into a pattern of selfish destruction, corruption and manipulation. But as things escalate, Hedda’s violent energies become magnified by her jealousy. We are shown the unfolding events of a single day and night, watching as Hedda applies increasing pressure to the three men in her life, culminating in a wicked scheme to regain power.

This production will strip away the stiffness and pomp of period versions, instead focusing on the raw interactions of Ibsen’s characters. Throughout rehearsals, we will explore the intertwining threads of each story, working towards building a dynamic and propellant show that simmers and crackles as the pressure climbs.

**CASTING NOTES**

Sensitive topics\
The play deals with themes of suicide. Exploring these characters’ motivations and experiences will be part of the rehearsal process. Other sensitive themes in this show include chauvinism and alcoholism. As a production, we are committed to creating a safe and open environment in which performers can work. Whilst we will do our utmost to ensure everyone feels safe within these scenes, actors should be mindful of the themes before auditioning.

Diversity and inclusion\
Sedos strives to ensure our activities are equally accessible to any person irrespective of race, colour, creed, ethnic or national origin, disability, religious belief, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, or class/socio-economic group. There are no characters of any specific ethnicity in this show, so we actively encourage actors of all ethnicities to audition for all parts.

Intimacy\
There are no moments of physical intimacy in the text, however, cast members will discuss and safely explore how their character interacts with the others. Throughout rehearsals, we will dig into how the physical contact between specific characters differs. The degree and nature of any physical contact will be down to the individual comfort levels of our cast.
