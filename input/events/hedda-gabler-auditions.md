**FROM THE DIRECTOR**

By default, Hedda is usually described as a ‘bored housewife’; this being the catalyst for many of her cruel antics. But for me, it doesn’t track. It feels reductive and something of a ‘character dead-end’. Reading this adaptation, it occurred to me: what if Hedda is actually scared that this is all there is? Afraid that it all amounts to nothing more than a mediocre existence.

The daughter of a powerful public figure, sold the grand promise of an extraordinary life. But it failed to live up to her expectations. Hedda echoes something that many people experience every day: frustration at the prospect of being ordinary. The monotonous hedonic treadmill - life’s highs always resetting to just ‘acceptable’ - feeding into dissatisfaction and tedium. There’s a bitterness that bubbles up. A resentment at being trapped in a merely tolerable life.

In addition, by becoming a Tesman through marriage, Hedda has demoted her status from that of a Gabler. We’ve now created a powerful concoction. Stripped of her social standing, perceiving herself as marginalised, she seeks to regain status by inverting the power structure that excludes her. In other words, she incites chaos. This destruction of order, for the status-oriented, becomes a way to reassert themselves. A ‘need for chaos’ that can rebalance power.
