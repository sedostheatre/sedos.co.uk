**FROM THE DIRECTOR**

By default, Hedda is usually described as a ‘bored housewife’; this being the catalyst for many of her cruel antics. But for me, it doesn’t track. It feels reductive and something of a ‘character dead-end’. Reading this adaptation, it occurred to me: what if Hedda is actually scared that this is all there is? Afraid that it all amounts to nothing more than a mediocre existence.

The daughter of a powerful public figure, sold the grand promise of an extraordinary life. But it failed to live up to her expectations. Hedda echoes something that many people experience every day: frustration at the prospect of being ordinary. The monotonous hedonic treadmill - life’s highs always resetting to just ‘acceptable’ - feeding into dissatisfaction and tedium. There’s a bitterness that bubbles up. A resentment at being trapped in a merely tolerable life.

In addition, by becoming a Tesman through marriage, Hedda has demoted her status from that of a Gabler. We’ve now created a powerful concoction. Stripped of her social standing, perceiving herself as marginalised, she seeks to regain status by inverting the power structure that excludes her. In other words, she incites chaos. This destruction of order, for the status-oriented, becomes a way to reassert themselves. A ‘need for chaos’ that can rebalance power.

**CASTING NOTES**

Sensitive topics\
The play deals with themes of suicide. Exploring these characters’ motivations and experiences will be part of the rehearsal process. Other sensitive themes in this show include chauvinism and alcoholism. As a production, we are committed to creating a safe and open environment in which performers can work. Whilst we will do our utmost to ensure everyone feels safe within these scenes, actors should be mindful of the themes before auditioning.

Diversity and inclusion\
Sedos strives to ensure our activities are equally accessible to any person irrespective of race, colour, creed, ethnic or national origin, disability, religious belief, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, or class/socio-economic group. There are no characters of any specific ethnicity in this show, so we actively encourage actors of all ethnicities to audition for all parts.\
\
Intimacy\
There are no moments of physical intimacy in the text, however, cast members will discuss and safely explore how their character interacts with the others. Throughout rehearsals, we will dig into how the physical contact between specific characters differs. The degree and nature of any physical contact will be down to the individual comfort levels of our cast.
