**ABOUT THE SHOW**

Based on the *Just So Stories* by Rudyard Kipling comes a British musical by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe. The original stories by Kipling tell of how the animals we know today acquired their unique traits. *Just So* the musical draws upon the original writing to tell the story of the Elephant’s Child, on a journey of self-discovery, in search of Pau Amma the great Crab that floods the plains. On the way he meets animals in the jungle, on the plains, on a seemingly uninhabited island, and by the great grey green Limpopo River.

Being so far from home, the Elephant’s Child needs a sidekick who can navigate. Together, the Kolokolo Bird (a flightless bird) make their journey to the mouth of the river to stop the Crab...

**CASTING, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION**

Sedos is committed to diversity and inclusion. Our commitment is to build and sustain a membership that is reflective of the diverse communities within London. We actively encourage all performers to audition for the roles which they feel best suit their skills.

We are seeking a diverse cast to take part in this production. We encourage auditionees to consider all parts, regardless of how these parts have previously been cast.

For some of the named roles accents are required as stated against the character, we however do not expect these to be perfect at the audition stage. 

Actors of all gender identities are very welcome to audition for any role. Please note that we are not able to transpose any vocal lines, and so would require performers to sing in the original keys written in the score. We are also not able to modify any of the text of the libretto including to change genders and so you must be comfortable portraying these as written.

We will consider performers with a disability for any role and would actively encourage disabled performers to audition.

Save for one role (The Parsee Man) we do not have any preconceived requirements for specific ethnicity in casting. We would actively encourage auditionees of all ethnicities to audition for the roles which do not have specific casting requirements.

*We intend to cast the part of Pestonjee Bomonjee, The Parsee Man authentically and as such, we will require an actor who presents as being Parsee in ethnicity. The Parsees were Persian peoples of Zoroastrian faith who were forced to migrate to India after the Arab conquest of Persia at the end of the 7th century. They largely settled within the Indian-subcontinent but were noted to be of different heritage to earlier established Indo-ethnic groups.*

*We will be seeking an actor who presents as Persian (modern day Iran and surrounds), Middle Eastern, or Parsee-Indian to play The Parsee Man. No specific accent is required for this part.*

*Note that this musical does not refer to Zoroastrianism or Parsee ethnic culture as part of the script or music. The origins of the character are based on a real-life Parsee artist that Rudyard Kipling was acquainted with during his life in Mumbai, India.*

Where an age range is listed in the character breakdown we will aim to cast age-appropriately. For all roles at auditions we are unable to cast anyone under the age of 18.

If you have any access requirements for the audition process, rehearsal process, or performances, please let us know and we will make any reasonable adjustments. If you have any further queries around the production, please feel free to get in touch and we will do our best to assist.
