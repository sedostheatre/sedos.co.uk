**The Sedos AGM will take place online on Thursday 4 June 2020, from 7pm,**

We plan on holding the AGM virtually, and will be providing some entertainment, in the form of a quiz, along with the formal business.

The AGM is your chance to hear about how the society is performing, and also to question the management committee and the trustees on the way that the society is run!

Members will also be able to vote in the election of trustees, and confirm the membership of the management committee for the year ahead.

Further details will be sent to members in due course.
