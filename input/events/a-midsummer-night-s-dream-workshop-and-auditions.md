**Registration is now open for A Midsummer Night’s Dream auditions.**

**ABOUT THE SHOW**

A queer re-telling of *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*. Shakespeare meets gig theatre; live music, dance, lip-sync battles, classic Shakespeare, all fused into one riotous night of theatrical comedy.

In this show we will have:

Classic Shakespeare \* Lesbian Lovers \* Homophobes we boo at \*Acoustic modern folk performances \* Lady Gaga songs \* Commercial Dance \* Ballroom and Voguing \* Funky Dungaree Dressed Mechanicals \* Drag King Performances \* Slapstick \* AFAB Queens \* Non-Binary Babes \* Lip-Sync Battles \* A show that is different every night \* An Emcee that holds it together * and much more!

This show will be a chaotic delight that will hopefully explore all the edges of the characters, our performers and our audiences. It will not be a show for the faint-hearted, not from a physical energy perspective for all our company, but from the point of view of the capacity to think big, play big and push ourselves to play expansively.

**KEY DATES**

**Workshop:** 19 May 7-9pm\
**First round auditions:** 30 May, 1, 3 and 4 June\
**Recalls:** 11 June \
**Performances:** 14-24 September at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell)

**WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR**

We are looking for a company of team players, ready to take on a fun challenge and step outside their comfort zones (a little bit). We will be looking for this in auditions, so come and play together, uplift each other and have some fun. The show is a comedy!

**Our production commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion**\
The show and process will be centred around Queer/LGBTQIA+ people and experiences. The Queer/LGBTQIA+ community is not a monolith, and is most beautiful because of the intersectionality within it. Therefore, we are really hoping to bring a diverse and inclusive group of creative humans together to perform this show. We would love to see people with diverse lived experiences at auditions. Whether that diversity is gender, sexuality, ethnicity, culture, race, age, disability, class and/or something we can not simply name in a list, we would love to meet you.

This does not mean that we don’t want cis, heterosexual people to audition, we want to see you too. But it does mean the themes and focus of the show will be on all things queer and our relationship to that, therefore be prepared to be presented with with that topic a lot in our process, and a request to learn/unlearn some things where required.

**Racial identity**\
We have a very open format to our casting with no pre-assigned racial identities to characters.

**Gender identity**\
Some of our roles are cis, some are non-binary/gender non-conforming, and many are flexible to what a performer brings to the table. We will share in the character breakdowns in the [full audition notice](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Qemw0eOQu5R6SwEJ5EXxC5jpM3vfMjj/view) our production point of view, but we are up for people to try things that are different to this and bring an audition that could change our perspective.

**Playing Age**\
Some characters have a playing age in the breakdown below, some do not. If there is no age then we are open to any age from 18+.
