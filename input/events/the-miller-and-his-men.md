**First performed in the year *Pride and Prejudice* was published, Regency melodrama *The Miller and his Men* entertained audiences in Britain and the USA before going on to engage generations of Toy Theatre owners as the most popular play.**

From first performances in 1813, it was still running in London in 1835, and in the USA until over 20 years later. \
\
Director, Peter Foster, writes: "I have a personal link to this play as it starred my four times great grandmother, Sarah Egerton, for its original London run at Covent Garden. In addition to that, I love the fact that it contains a host of three-dimensional characters, with heroes, lovers, villains, and acts of revenge and rescue, culminating in a final scene worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster".\
\
Successful melodramas are still very popular today as musicals, soap operas and movies. Loved by actors and audiences alike, a good melodrama contains dynamic characters in a fast-moving plot. They may not be great literature, but they certainly make great theatre.
