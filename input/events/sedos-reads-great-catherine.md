**Our current season of three Sedos Reads plays ends with Bernard Shaw's *Great Catherine.*** 

George Bernard Shaw wrote his one-act comedy or light-hearted appreciation of the famous Russian Empress, *Great Catherine,* in 1913, and it was performed in the same year at the Vaudeville Theatre, London.

Rehearsals will be on Tuesday 6, Thursday 8 and Tuesday 13 April all from 7-9pm. The performance is on Thursday 15 April at 7.30pm. \
