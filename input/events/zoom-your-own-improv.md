**Following their stirling efforts over the past few months, the Banana Hut Gang are taking a break from performing for a little bit.**

If you don't know how you'll cope without them, all their Zoom and some of their 'before-times' shows can be seen on their [YouTube channel]([https://www.youtube.com/​channel/​UC2gp5U6JvDumjMpCSqntSdA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2gp5U6JvDumjMpCSqntSdA)).
