**Eight gay men.**\
**Three long weekends.**\
**One last summer.**

Winner of the 1995 Tony Award for Best Play, *[Love! Valour! Compassion](https://sedos.l3v5y.co.uk/shows/2020-love-valour-compassion)!* is a monumental exploration into life, love and loss at the end of the millennium.

As hilarious as it is heart-breaking, Terence McNally's seminal work captures the zeitgeist of 90s America and forces the question - when reality hits home, who and what is most important to us?

We are looking for a diverse group of seven strong character actors to stage this seldom performed piece.
