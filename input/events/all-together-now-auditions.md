**ALL TOGETHER NOW!**\
\
To celebrate the return of live theatre, we are joining forces with our friends at Centre Stage, Geoids and Bishopsgate Institute to stage the unique new revue, *All Together Now!*.

The show is a global celebration of musical theatre put together by Music Theatre International (MTI) packed full of numbers from their beloved shows. Amateur groups and schools across the world will all be performing this show on the same weekend and we are excited to be part of it.

**Auditions**

Auditions will be held on Friday 8 and Sunday 10 October. The show is made up of solos right through to full cast numbers so we are looking for an ensemble of strong singers with excellent ability to act through song. Slots can be booked at [membership.sedos.co.uk](http://membership.sedos.co.uk/)

See our [audition notice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pSEUex-eKejCAzho10dR8vs73MUqpgkErZ7lensyQtg/edit) for full details.

Performances will be on 12 and 13 November in the Great Hall at Bishopsgate Institute.

**Diversity and inclusion**

We actively encourage performers to audition for the roles which best suit their skills. We are committed to diverse and inclusive casting. As a concert, there are no parts which require specific characteristics. All parts are open to interpretation and performers or any ethnicity, gender, sexuality, size or age are encouraged to apply, we are not necessarily trying to replicate any original casting or recordings.
