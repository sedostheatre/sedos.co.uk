***[Working](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-working)*** **was cast in January 2020 for a run later that year. Unfortunately when the show was rescheduled after the Covid-19 postponement, two of the actors were unable to join the cast, so we are now holding auditions – more details below or check out the [full audition notice here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pi_772eXt9joeRPk92OnFONF0QxetCdZrHZgR8E12kg/edit).**

**About the show**

In 1974 Chicago radio broadcaster Studs Terkel published a best selling compilation of interviews with a cross section of Americans talking about their jobs. In 2007-2008 additional interviews were conducted. Terkel described it as the extraordinary dreams of ordinary people. Working is the musical adaptation of Terkel’s book, and the words of the people he interviewed. It was first conceived by Stephen Schwartz (Godspell, Pippin, Wicked) and staged on Broadway in 1978. 

Working is a delightfully funny and thoroughly touching musical which explores what goes through the minds of everyday people - from construction workers and waitresses to firemen, secretaries and cleaning women. It showcases the individuals’ occupations and also laments their lost hopes and dreams - taking the average worker’s viewpoint and showing that he or she is anything but average.

**What are we seeking?** 

*Working* is a show where each actor plays several roles. We are looking to fill six female-identifying roles, with the potential to divide them between two or three actors. All actors will also participate in the ensemble for the group numbers.

We are looking to cast at least two actors, one of whom will need to realistically portray the 50+-year-old schoolteacher Rose (this role can be played by an actor of any race or ethnicity who is not Latinx) and another who will portray Maggie, a Black woman. The other roles offer a range of ages from 20 upwards and can be played by actors of any race or ethnicity.

The flexible nature of the show means we can work around the auditionees we see and therefore they encourage anyone to audition – above all, we are looking for great singers and actors.
