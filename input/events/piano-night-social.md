**WEDNESDAY 28 JULY | From 7.30pm**\
**Part of the [Sedos Members' Week](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-welcome-back-members-week)**

**Whether you want to get up and sing or just relax and enjoy a drink with friends, our Piano Night Social is the perfect event to bring you back to the Bridewell Theatre, which will be transformed into a relaxed, intimate cabaret venue for an evening of song and Sedos reunion!**

Join our musical maestros Michael Cannon and Wil Gaines and entertain us with a torch song, modern belter or classic showstopper. The choice is yours! We’ll have some musical scores and collections to browse through, but if you’re looking for something specific, please feel free to bring along your own music.

Alternatively, grab a drink and catch-up with friends while listening to some great music. It’s going to be a friendly, relaxed event and the perfect opportunity to get us back together again.

The Piano Night Social is free to attend, but please register on our box office so we know how many people to expect!
