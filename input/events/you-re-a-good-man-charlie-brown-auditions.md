**ABOUT THE SHOW**

With charm, wit and heart, *You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown* explores life through the eyes of Charlie Brown and his friends in the Peanuts gang.

Based on the beloved Charles Schulz comic strip, Charlie Brown and the entire Peanuts bunch explore life’s great questions as they play baseball, struggle with homework, sing songs, swoon over their crushes, and celebrate the joy of friendship.

Charlie Brown, who has never been able to keep a kite in the air, wonders what it takes to be a ‘good man’ as he sees Schroeder’s passion for Beethoven, Lucy’s psychiatrist booth, Linus’ complex about his blanket, Sally’s new philosophy and Snoopy’s ace flying ability. In this delightful musical comedy, Charlie Brown, with the help of his friends, comes to realise what makes them all truly happy.

**CASTING**

All roles are open to performers of any ethnicity. We are open to diverse casting, and actively encourage performers to audition for the roles which best suit their skills.

As this is a show where adults play children (and a dog), we will consider performers of all ages (18+) for all roles.

Sedos are committed to inclusivity of all gender expressions and identities. All named roles are gender-identified in the casting breakdown.

**WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?**

*You’re A Good Man, Charlie Brown* is a lively, fast-paced musical, full of laughs and heartfelt moments of friendship. We are looking for performers who can embody these iconic characters with charm and humour. They are young but are often wise beyond their years - think child-like innocence without slipping into immature naivety. 

There will be a decent amount of movement for everyone - dancing with security blankets, enacting a baseball game, creating a mid-air chase sequence in Snoopy’s imagination - but enthusiasm is more important than technique! 

The show is not set in a precise location - general American accents will be fine for all characters. 

This is a small cast ensemble show, and all performers will have plenty to do - we want a cast who are full of energy, on the ball, and up for bringing these amazing characters to life!
