Registration is now open for *[The Effect](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2023-the-effect)* auditions. 

**ABOUT THE SHOW**

What we are looking to create is something that can truly challenge an audience; to raise questions about morality, reality vs artifice, the power of influence and assumption, the institutions we trust, the nature of love and the scope of our brain’s untapped capability.

This is going to be a raw, visceral and unflinching psychological thriller that toys with an audience’s trust and perception. The show’s events take place during a drug trial - the outcome being to confirm whether the drug in question has antidepressant effects.

But quickly we realise everything is not as it seems. As the trial collapses around the audience they are faced with a growing sense of unease...

If we succeed in the show, the audience should leave reeling, challenged, and in a buzz of discussion.
