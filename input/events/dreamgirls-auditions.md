**ABOUT THE SHOW**

*Dreamgirls* is a vibrant and emotionally charged musical that pulses with the sound of Motown and the heart of the American dream. Set in the dynamic world of rhythm n’ blues, the award-winning *Dreamgirls*explores the journey of a young female singing trio whose lives are transformed by music, fame, and ambition. But all that glitters has its price.

*Dreamgirls* in the Bridewell Theatre means this will be a very intimate version, and in order to heighten the emotional storytelling even more, the staging will be stripped back to its essentials. The entire space will function as both stage and backstage, a performance arena where scenes shift in a continuous, cinematic flow – like one long, emotionally-charged music video. Costume changes, lighting shifts, and even the machinery of show business will be exposed and folded into the action. In this world, performance *is* life – and life, at times, must be performed. But don’t worry, the glamourous, glitzy, and glittery world of the Dreams will still come to life on our stage. You can’t have *Dreamgirls* without a few sequins…

At the heart of this production is also a celebration of the extraordinary musical evolution that shaped the 1960s and 70s – thanks to the influence of Black music, especially in radio. As our story unfolds, so too does the soundscape: from the clean harmonies and choreography of early R&B to the rawer, funkier textures of soul, disco, and beyond. It reflects a changing sense of identity, ownership, and self-expression within Black culture and performance in a White-dominated industry.

**ROLES**

Our production of *Dreamgirls* needs performers with the keen ability to bring their own unique personalities to the roles. The challenge is not to replicate the material, but to tell it in our own way – for our own audiences now. 

We are looking to cast around 22-25 people to play principal and supporting roles.This production requires a largely Black cast to tell this story authentically, so we will be looking to cast principal roles and many featured roles from Black racial groups for *Dreamgirls**.*** While most roles in *Dreamgirls* specifically require Black actors, there are some roles specifically for White actors. We are also looking to cast a culturally-diverse ensemble to create a dynamically diverse story on our stage.

Please read the full audition notice for details of the roles.

**DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN CASTING**

Sedos is committed to ensuring our activities are equally accessible to any person irrespective of race, colour, creed, ethnic or national origin, disability, religious belief, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, or class/socio-economic group. As this show contains mostly **roles for Black characters**, we hope that you will understand that not every race can be considered for all roles to tell this story authentically and appropriately.

If you are unsure about whether or not you should audition, please reach out to the team at [dreamgirls@sedos.co.uk](mailto:dreamgirls@sedos.co.uk) to check! We will do our best to answer any questions you have about being involved.

You can read Sedos’s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion policy in full [here](https://www.sedos.co.uk/assets/policies/2022-10-edi-policy.pdf).
