**ABOUT THE SHOW**

An enduring story of blame, paranoia and betrayal, but also a tale of love and loyalty. Miller’s 1952 play is set during the Salem Witch Trials, in Massachusetts in 1692. Teenager Abigail Williams leads a group of girls in accusing members of their tight-knit community of witchcraft. Elizabeth, the wife of John Proctor, a middle-aged farmer who Abigail had an affair with, finds herself caught up in the cycle of suspicion, and is also accused of witchcraft. 

Desperate to clear Elizabeth’s name, John tries to persuade the court of her innocence, but Abigail turns on him, and John is arrested for witchcraft himself. John is caught in an impossible dilemma, between confessing to witchcraft and saving his life, and protecting his family’s reputation in his own death. This play is based on real events.

What if we suggest that truth and fiction – right and wrong, science and magic – are not so easy to distinguish? This raises the stakes and highlights to the audience their own susceptibility to propaganda, paranoia, and the beliefs of others. 

With this production, we want to blend truth and lies to show the audience the real and disastrous extent to which when it’s one person’s word against another’s, fiction can spiral out of control, destroying identities along the way.

**CASTING NOTES**

Sedos is committed to diversity and inclusion. Our commitment is to build and sustain a membership that is reflective of the diverse communities within London. We actively encourage all performers to audition for the roles which they feel best suit their skills.

We want this version of *The Crucible* to give the audience that helpless sense of betrayal when you’re surrounded by people who should trust you, but don’t. To do that, we want the cast to represent a modern community in London today, so we are looking to cast a very diverse Salem community.
