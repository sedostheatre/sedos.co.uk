The Banana Hut Gang is looking to grow, and for the first time since being formed, is opening up [London auditions](https://sedos.co.uk/get-involved) for the group!

**[READ THE FULL AUDITION NOTICE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-xqqJ63kKp9HCeC8rPMHXHyQmIiV6msRY1AtfTGkcD0/edit)**

Auditions are 1 and 3 February, from 7-8.30 pm.

New members will join the team to learn and perform their smash-hit, *Choose Your Own... Improv!* at the Edinburgh Fringe 2022, and also help them develop new formats!

The Banana Hut Gang are looking for people who already have good experience improvising, and are super keen to see a diverse group of auditionees.

If you think this is you, or someone you know, check out the [audition notice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-xqqJ63kKp9HCeC8rPMHXHyQmIiV6msRY1AtfTGkcD0/edit)!
