**Carols under the Christmas Tree in Trafalgar Square in aid of Glassdoor**



As is becoming an annual tradition - we're heading to Trafalgar Square for some impromptu carolling under the Christmas Tree! 

This year we're shaking buckets and collecting in aid of Glassdoor - the homelessness charity who do incredible work, especially during the winter season.



**Location: Trafalgar Square**

**Meet Time: 7:30PM behind the Christmas Tree where the performances are**

**Singing Time: 8:00PM - 9:00PM**

**Dress Code: Festive red!** *We will be outside so please dress for the weather!*



All of the sheet music for carols (mostly traditional ones!) will be e-mailed to you before the day - we won't be printing any copies (let's be sustainable!) so we'd suggest that you read them from your phone or tablet device.



We'll sojourn to a pub afterwards for a festive tipple too!
