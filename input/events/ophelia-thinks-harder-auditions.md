Ophelia Thinks Harder was due to be performed in March 2020, one week after the first lockdown was announced. Due to the way the world and individual circumstances have changed, we are now seeking auditionees for several roles. For further details, please download the audition pack [here](https://sedos.co.uk/assets/ophelia-2021-audition-pack.pdf).

**Synopsis**

Ophelia is struggling with the constraints place on her by her social status – as a woman, as a royal, and as a player trapped in a male narrative. However, after a series of encounters with ghosts, actors, wise women and psychologists she is given fresh hope. Will Ophelia realise her own agency and break out of the patriarchal chains of Hamlet’s story, or remain trapped forever? Ophelia Thinks Harder is a riotous comedy that subverts our expectations of Shakespeare’s heroine, and yes – she gets to do the “To be or not to be” speech.

**What are we looking for**

The roles to be auditioned for are listed below. As this play deals substantially with gender and gender roles, the list below shows the gender each character needs to present as. The exceptions to this are the Players, which are written as male but don’t need to be believable as men if women are cast in those roles. There are no specific ethnicity requirements for any of the roles; we are open to non-traditional casting and would like to see performers of all ethnicities audition for any roles. There are also no age requirements for any of the roles and we're excited to see what you can bring to the roles.

*Maid (f)* – a much put-upon servant. Frequently the subject of harassment and abuse. The counterpoint to Ophelia, and a representative of the serving classes who don’t have an opportunity to improve their situation. Very superstitious, to the detriment of her sanity.

*Rosencrantz (f)* – a behavioural psychologist come to observe Hamlet. Takes a keener interest in Ophelia.

*Guildenstern (f)* – another behavioural psychologist come to observe Hamlet. Also takes a keener interest in Ophelia.

*St Joan/Woman 3 (f)* – the ghost of Joan of Arc. Also plays a mysterious wise woman.

*Woman 2/Queen’s Maid (f)* – another mysterious wise woman, and a handmaid to the Queen.

*Laertes (m)* – Ophelia’s brother and a prime example of toxic masculinity.

*Player 1 (m)* - one of the band of travelling players come to perform for the court (but is that their only mission?) Takes on the role of the Father in the play-within-the-play.

*Player 2 (m)* - one of the band of travelling players come to perform for the court (but is that their only mission?) Takes on the role of the Mother in the play-within-the-play.
