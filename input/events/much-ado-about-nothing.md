**Sedos is excited to present an abridged reading of Shakespeare's classic comedy. *Much Ado About Nothing*, via Zoom on Thursday 8 October.**

As this is the inaugural reading in our new series, we will be playing around with things, finding out what works, etc. As such, we may change the process in following weeks, but here's how it will work for now:

* Applications to read will be accepted via the form below until 7pm on Sunday (please ensure you submit BOTH the form and an audition video).
* Casting will be announced on Monday evening via social media (and the cast will be emailed with the script).
* A brief technical rehearsal for the cast will take place via Zoom on Thursday at 7pm.
* The performance will take place via Zoom on Thursday at 8.30pm.

Thanks to those who have already applied - you don't need to do anything else as long as we have your form and video.

We look forward to hearing from anyone else who would like to take part. Here's how you do it:

* Fill in the application form at [https://forms.gle/â€‹qFLiK1M1Gb7ZZByr9](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001JQtKKbd2fTAJGKjLO3ddtPdF7vYrevHgX2JsQoEX0e6slTww77XfJTl1hctZTzvMUm2cHK64C-MT7NnGN_-h1DZLSTzi-unRonujRhPjFnBsgbDQ_H06kL_Hcv6bLlVJoYHZLFIgPbkIfnLNAzXtXW-VCVDDTWf7LnwhzrKx-aw0BJi4nrSruacH8yQGIKK1&c=zHqWfux0VumhD74i0CJ4Sd4jeONzCkr2qHDnZSa7p64blXC3VrnwGA==&ch=5ZFjp4Fu0tnfkjVpghwSjC_DBq3sfkYZpx9K5sJDmBzu4jne2BuYTQ==).
* Send a short, filmed reading of a monologue (maximum of 2 minutes) to [readings@sedos.co.uk](mailto:readings@sedos.co.uk) via WeTransfer.

If you would just like to join us as an audience member, you are more than welcome. Please email us for the Zoom link - we have a limited number of people able to join our Zoom meetings, so it will be a matter of first come, first served. The reading will last approximately one hour.

If you have any questions, please email [readings@sedos.co.uk](mailto:readings@sedos.co.uk). We look forward to seeing you online soon.
