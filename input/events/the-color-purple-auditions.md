**INTRODUCTION TO THE SHOW**

*The Color Purple* documents the traumas and gradual triumph of Celie, an African American teenager raised in rural isolation in Georgia. Celie narrates her life through painfully honest letters to God. 

Based on the 1983 Pulitzer-prize-winning Novel by Alice Walker, the musical was first performed on Broadway in 2005 and was nominated for 11 Tony Awards in 2006. The enthusiastically acclaimed Broadway revival, starring Cynthia Erivo, Jennifer Hudson and Danielle Brooks opened in late 2015 and ran through early 2017, winning two 2016 Tony Awards – including Best Revival of a Musical.

In 2024 the musical was made into a movie for the big screen where it has swept up many awards nominations including Danielle Brooks as Sofia for the Academy Award for Actress in a supporting role. 

The story weaves an intricate mosaic of women joined by their love for each other, the men who abuse them, and the children they care for.

**WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR**

We’ll be casting 20-25 performers for the cast of *The Color Purple: The Musical*. As a musical, everyone in the cast will be required to sing, act and dance in the show. The characters in the show are all African-American and live in the USA during a 40-year period in the early 20th century. 

There are eight lead roles (five female, three male. There are also a number of supporting roles for men and women plus an ensemble for a range of ages and genders. We’re unable to change the gender of these characters, however, as long as you are comfortable portraying a specific gender, we welcome you to audition for whoever you like. 

Everyone invited to join the cast will be required to attend rehearsals between August and November 2024 as well as mandatory dates in the lead up to the show. So, we are looking for a talented, committed and passionate group of people to cast in this show. 

**DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN CASTING**

This production requires a Black cast, so we will only be looking to cast people from Black racial groups.  

Sedos is committed to ensuring our activities are equally accessible to any person irrespective of race, colour, creed, ethnic or national origin, disability, religious belief, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, or class/socio-economic group. As this show contains only roles for Black characters, we hope that you will understand that not every race can be considered this time in order to tell this story authentically and appropriately. 

If you are unsure about whether or not you should audition, please reach out to us and check! We will do our best to answer any questions you have about being involved.
