**Do you know your Shakespeare from your Sondheim? Your Arthur Miller from your Arthur Laurents? Your Milky Whites from your Saturday Nights?**

Celebrate the end of dry January with our first fundraiser social of the year on Saturday 3 February - pit your wits against the return of the Sedos Quiz hosted by our very own Sedos legend - Mr James ‘Etches’ Franey.

Serving more than just brain teasers over five rounds - we’ll be serving refreshments at our house bar (card payments only) from Six - 6pm, not the musical.

Assemble your teams (of up to six people) and get thinking of a prizeworthy trendy team name to register on the night - solo brainboxes are also welcome to join a team on arrival.

All proceeds go towards supporting Sedos and our upcoming production of Just So.
