**ABOUT THE SHOW**

> “If I could, I’d bring them all down to their knees!\
> I’d make them sorry forever for teasing Carrie!”

Carrie White is a misfit. At school, she's an outcast who's bullied by the popular crowd, and virtually invisible to everyone else. At home, she's at the mercy of her over-protective, hyper-religious mother. But there’s something different about Carrie – she has a special power. A power that can be destructive. And if she’s pushed too far, she may have to use it…

Based on Stephen King's bestselling novel and the acclaimed movie starring Sissy Spacek, Carrie has been reinvented for our time in a new production sure to shake the Bridewell to its very core...

**CONCEPT**

We are thrilled to be staging *Carrie* at the Bridewell this October in a production which promises to offer some fantastic opportunities for talented performers in a thrilling semi-immersive, special effects-packed production.

The Bridewell will be stripped back to its bare bones to throw audiences into the terrifying world of Carrie’s infamous senior prom.

**KEY DATES**

**Pre-audition workshop:** Wednesday 29 June\
**Auditions:** Monday 11, Tuesday 12 and Saturday 16 July\
**Recalls:** Saturday 23 July

**EQUALITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION | CASTING**

Sedos seeks to build and sustain a membership that is reflective of the diverse communities within London. We actively encourage performers to audition for the roles which they feel best suit their skills. *Carrie* is a show that allows us to be diverse and inclusive in our casting and we will be actively looking to cast as diverse a group of people as possible, irrespective of the casting of previous productions.

We are looking for a cast of approximately 16 who can do justice to the music of the show and work together to tell a story. All cast must have some sense of movement, but don’t need to be dancers. 

The roles of Carrie, Tommy, Sue, Chris and Billy, as well as the Ensemble, will need to realistically portray senior high school students aged around 16-17.

Aside from these requirements, we will consider anyone for any role, regardless of race, gender, sex, disability or any other characteristic, provided that person has the vocal range for the role. Note that we will not be transposing to accommodate voice type, so please bear that in mind.
