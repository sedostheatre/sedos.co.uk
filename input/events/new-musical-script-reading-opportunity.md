**Friend of Sedos and professional producer Oli Sones is looking for members interested in a reading of a brand new musical.** 

*Little Earth* is based on the songs of Gilbert and Sullivan, but set in a Sci-Fi world (think *Return to the Forbidden Planet* but operetta!).

The dream is for the show to be performed by amateur groups all over the world and Oli's team thought what better place to start than an initial script read with our very own Sedos members. 

The show is looking for 13 people aged 18 and over. There are no specific requirements for casting and we would encourage all to apply.

If you'd like to take part - please e-mail a short CV (not more than 100 words) to [membership@sedos.co.uk](email:membership@sedos.co.uk) - The script read is scheduled for the evening of Tuesday 25 April (Location TBC but likely in Zone 1/2)
