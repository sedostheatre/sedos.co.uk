Due to unforeseen circumstances, we are recasting the role of Tristan in *[The Effect](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2023-the-effect?mc_cid=288bc18fd7&mc_eid=UNIQID)*, our March show which plays at the Bridewell Theatre from 21-25 March.\
\
The **first round of auditions is via selftape only and is due by 10am this Friday** (27 January).\
\
The **recalls will take place this Saturday** (28 January), by invitation, between 11am and 3pm. Please only send a tape if you are available for this session – you won’t be needed the whole time, but we will only be casting from those called that day. 

For full details on how this recasting process will work:\
\
(1) Please watch this video message from director Jonathon Harding-Cooper.\
\
(2) Please read the [audition instructions document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k5CB1mOlxCTpNMagwoBDph7hJyXdiTyNQQ0z5-4Sp44/edit).\

While the unfortunate need to recast is never something you hope for or expect, we are excited for another person to join us in this incredibly powerful production!
