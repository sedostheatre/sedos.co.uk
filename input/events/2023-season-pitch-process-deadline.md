**We are now accepting applications for shows for the 2023 Sedos Season, where we are intending to perform two two-week musicals; one two-week play; one one-week play; plus an additional week to be decided. These productions will take place at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell), central London, where we are the resident theatre company.**

If you are a director, producer, choreographer, musical director - or just have a great idea for a show that you want to suggest to us - please get your thinking caps on! Even if you are not attached to a specific pitch, then it's a great time to let us know that you would like to be involved in a creative team!

We’d love to receive pitches from anyone who wants to apply, no matter their background. As a society, we are committed to being [as inclusive as possible](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-a-new-commitment-to-diversity-and-inclusion) and therefore are looking for a truly diverse range of people to come forward to be involved both on stage and off.

The application form and guidance notes can be found at the links below:

We look forward to hearing from you!
