**Your society needs you!**

The Sedos Annual General meeting will take place on Thursday 9 June - timings and location to follow. 

The AGM is your chance to hear about how the society is performing, and also to probe the Management Committee and the Trustees on the way that the society is run.

The Board of Trustees and the Management Committee are RECRUITING; further details on what posts are available and how to apply will be posted here in the coming days. 

We hope to see you all there!
