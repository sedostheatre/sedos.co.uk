**About the show**

Based on the film of the same name, [*Dirty Rotten Scoundrels* (performance dates 24 November-4 December 2021)](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-dirty-rotten-scoundrels) tells the story of two very different con men, the debonair Laurence Jameson and the vulgar Freddie Benson. The chalk and cheese con men know they can’t both work the same resort so they decide to make a bet. The first to make €50,000 from one of the many wealthy ladies of the French Riviera town of Beaumont Sur Mare, will get to stay, the loser has to leave town. All they have to decide is who is the mark and no mark is more loaded and less aware than the American Soap Queen herself, Christine Colegate. As they try their different approaches to get the dough they find that Christine isn’t as easy as they first thought and that this con is going to be harder, more painful but the most fun they’ve ever had.

Nominated for 11 Tony Awards in 2005 with original Broadway cast including John Lithgow, Norbert Leo Butz and Sherie Rene Scott. This show has it all from glitzy dance numbers to hilarious songs and stupid jokes.

**What are we seeking?**

This is a show with a large cast – nine named roles, plus an ensemble. There are roles for those in their 20s to those in their 60s, with a range of voices required. Dancers are needed, but there are also parts where less movement is required.

This is a fun, silly and crass show, which requires a cast with stage presence, comedy timing and energy.  We are excited to get back in the rehearsal room, after such a long time away and want to create something to really reward performers and audiences alike for getting through these testing times. We don’t want a carbon copy of the characters that you are familiar with in the film and show. Make them your own.

Full details are in [the audition notice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V6QmXfkfOrVPqRh9ZqOy1c2zngU-diBXbV9FrQOZGUU/edit). 

**When and where are the auditions?**

The first round auditions are remote, with auditionees sending in a self tape video of a comic musical theatre song of your choice (maximum two minutes). The deadline for these is 16 July at midday. Find out more about what to include in your video and how to submit it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V6QmXfkfOrVPqRh9ZqOy1c2zngU-diBXbV9FrQOZGUU/edit).

**Diversity and inclusion**

Sedos seeks to build and sustain a membership that is reflective of the diverse communities within London. We actively encourage performers to audition for the roles which best suit their skills. Where any roles require specific characteristics, this is set out in the audition notice. For all other roles, we are open to and encourage diverse casting and we are excited to see what you can bring to the role.
