**ABOUT THE SHOW**

Welcome to Bobby’s place – the lights are low, the drinks are flowing, and the guests are ready to celebrate... whether Bobby likes it or not.

In this intimate, immersive staging of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth’s *Company*, you’re not just in the audience, you’re on the guest list for Bobby’s surprise 35th birthday party. The apartment is yours to explore: the kitchen hums with chatter, the sofa hosts whispered confessions, and somewhere between the wine glasses and the cake, the truth about love, marriage, and commitment is laid bare.

*Company* is a sharp, witty, and deeply human portrait of modern relationships, told through a kaleidoscope of vignettes that capture the joy, chaos, and heartbreak of being part of someone else’s life. Friends, lovers, exes, and almosts swirl around Bobby in a heady mix of cocktails, candour, and Sondheim’s razor-sharp score, from the blistering comedy of Getting Married Today to the aching vulnerability of Being Alive.

In this reimagining, the walls between audience and performer disappear. You’ll find yourself in the thick of it, clinking glasses, dodging dance moves, and catching every smirk, sigh, and side-eye up close. A multiple award-winning masterpiece, *Company* remains one of musical theatre’s most incisive and entertaining dissections of human connection.

Step inside. Join the party. And maybe, just maybe, find the answer to what it means to be alive.

**DIRECTOR’S VISION NOTE**

Our production of *Company* transforms the Bridewell Theatre into Bobby’s New York apartment, immersing the audience directly into the psychological and social world of the show. Rather than observing from a distance, they arrive as guests at Bobby’s 35th birthday party, greeted at the back entrance, guided down a hallway of memories, and invited into a fully realised loft apartment filled with music, conversation, and tension.

The immersive environment allows *Company’s* fragmented structure to come alive spatially: arguments can break out in the kitchen, toasts can erupt in the living room, and private confessions can unfold just inches from the audience. Instead of travelling to his friends, Bobby’s world comes to him, turning his apartment into both a literal and metaphorical stage for memory, intimacy, and isolation.

By staging the band in an “apartment across the alley,” and dotting couples among the audience, we collapse the distance between performer and spectator. Guests are part of the celebration yet uncomfortably close to Bobby’s loneliness, invited to confront the show’s central question: Is being alone better than being with the wrong person? This vision is not about making the audience perform but about immersing them in an atmosphere, an experience of proximity, honesty, and recognition. Party hats, decorations, and electronic invitations extend the story beyond the theatre, making the event feel lived-in before the first note is sung.

Our *Company* is sharp, funny, and poignant, trailblazing as one of the first immersive interpretations of this landmark musical. It invites audiences not just to watch Bobby’s search for connection, but to live inside it. 

The *Company* team is honoured that the Trustees have approved a grant for this production from Jeremy Lewis funds. Jeremy was a former chair of Sedos who left a legacy to the society to provide productions with money to enable visions that teams could not complete within a regular budget, without which it would not be possible to complete the apartment transformation of the Bridewell.

**SHOW FEES**

If you are cast in *Company*, you must become a member of Sedos (membership is currently £30 per year if paid by direct debit; £40 if paid as a one-off). There is also a participation fee of £120, which goes towards the cost of putting on the show.

**DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN CASTING**

Sedos is committed to diversity and inclusion. Our commitment is to build and sustain a membership that is reflective of the diverse communities within London. We actively encourage all performers to audition for the roles which they feel best suit their skills. Across the entire cast there are opportunities for actors of all ages, ethnicities and genders to be cast, with the primary consideration in casting being the performers’ ability to sing and act in their assigned role. We will not be transposing any vocal lines (other than potentially changing the octave).

We are aware that the characters in *Company* are traditionally cisgender and heterosexual, however we strongly encourage auditionees of all ethnicities, genders and sexualities to audition for our show. Our production of Company celebrates the richness of human experience and the variety of voices, stories, and perspectives that make theatre vibrant and relevant. We are committed to inclusive casting and strongly encourage performers of all ethnicities, genders, abilities, sexual orientations, and backgrounds to audition. We believe that a diverse ensemble not only reflects the world we live in but also deepens the emotional truth and resonance of Stephen Sondheim’s work.

Due to licensing restrictions, we are unable to change the gender or pronouns of the characters as written in the show; nor are we able to transpose vocal parts. Performers will therefore be required to present the roles in accordance with the licensed material.

That said, we warmly encourage non-binary, trans, and gender-fluid performers to audition for whichever roles they feel most comfortable portraying, while noting the above licensing constraints. Sedos is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, and respectful environment for all performers, in line with our core values.

In our vision, characters are defined by their humanity, relationships, and emotional journeys, not by narrow or traditional assumptions about appearance, age, or identity. We welcome performers who bring authenticity, imagination, and individuality to their roles. *Company* is a story about love, connection, and the complexities of modern relationships, and it shines brightest when told by a cast that represents the breadth and depth of the world around us.
