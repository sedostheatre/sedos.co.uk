**ABOUT THE SHOW**

*The Color Purple* is a well-known novel that many of us will have studied at school. Written by Alice Walker it won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. *The Color Purple* documents the traumas and gradual triumph of Celie, an African American teenager raised in rural isolation in Georgia. Celie narrates her life through painfully honest letters to God. The story weaves an intricate mosaic of women joined by their love for each other, the men who abuse them, and the children they care for.

The musical was first performed in 2005 and was nominated for 11 Tony Awards in 2006. The enthusiastically acclaimed Broadway revival, starring Cynthia Erivo, opened in late 2015 and ran through early 2017, winning two 2016 Tony Awards — including Best Revival of a Musical.

**ABOUT THE PRE-AUDITION WORKSHOPS**

The workshops are an opportunity to meet the team and learn more about *The Color Purple*. The team will talk about their vision for this production before working as a group to learn some of the singing and choreography from the show. This is also a very good opportunity to ask any questions you may have.

You don’t need to prepare anything for the workshop and it is free to attend. Attendance is not compulsory and will not affect your chances of being cast. Make sure you wear or bring loose clothing that is appropriate for moving or dancing in. Please note: workshops are free, but sign-up is mandatory. Sign-up is not open yet.

**DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN CASTING**

This production requires a Black cast, so we will only be looking to cast people from Black racial groups.  

Sedos is committed to ensuring our activities are equally accessible to any person irrespective of race, colour, creed, ethnic or national origin, disability, religious belief, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, or class/socio-economic group. As this show contains only roles for Black characters, we hope that you will understand that not every race can be considered this time in order to tell this story authentically and appropriately. 

If you are unsure about whether or not you should audition, please reach out to us and check! We will do our best to answer any questions you have about being involved.
