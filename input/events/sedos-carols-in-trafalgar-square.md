**Carolling is back!** 

We will be performing at Trafalgar Square 4-5pm on Saturday 1t December. You are welcome to join us at Trafalgar Square from 3:30pm or for a rehearsal at Theatre Deli Leadenhall Street from 12pm.

Everyone of any ability level is welcome to join, but if you are not a confident sight-singer we highly recommend joining for the rehearsal so that you can enjoy yourself with confidence.
