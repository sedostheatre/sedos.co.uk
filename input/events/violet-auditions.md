**INTRODUCTION TO THE SHOW**

*Violet* tells the story of a strong willed young woman seeking to ‘right’ the wrongs of her life which she puts largely down to a facial scar caused by an accident during her childhood. 

The story tells of her life and journey across the deep south from the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina seeking a ‘TV Evangelist healer’ in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who she believes will heal her facial scar, allowing her to live the life she wants to live. Along the way she meets a multitude of characters including Flick and Monty – two soldiers who befriend Violet and despite their friendship with each other have a very different outlook on life and relationships.

The show is an absolute powerhouse of emotion and this is delivered through a well metered book with a musical score which really hits home at all the right points. Much like Jeanie Tesori’s other works (*Fun Home* and *Caroline, or Change* in particular), the music is intricate and clever with detailed harmony creating fitting textures for a book which touches upon some very current and well written issues.

**WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR**

We’ll be casting 14 performers for the cast of *Violet.* With a small cast and lots of characters, there is no hiding on the singing or acting fronts – we're looking for confident singers who can carry a harmony line on their own as well as singing solo and engaging actors who are able to collaborate and work with the creative team on telling the best version of the story. There are five principal roles (two female and three male) with the remaining nine parts (five female and four male) having tracks more akin to featured ensemble roles. We’re unable to change the gender of these characters, however, as long as you are comfortable portraying a specific gender, we welcome you to audition for whoever you like.

Everyone invited to join the cast will be required to attend rehearsals between December 2024 (last rehearsal before Christmas being 19 December), as well as mandatory dates in the lead up to the show. So, we are looking for a talented, committed and passionate group of people to cast in this show.

**DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN CASTING**

Sedos strives to ensure our activities are equally accessible to any person irrespective of race, colour, creed, ethnic or national origin, disability, religious belief, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, or class/socio-economic group. We are also committed to authentic storytelling and ensuring that those roles which require specific casting are cast appropriately. 

The parts of Flick, Almeta, and Lula Buffington all present important African-American stories as Black characters living in 1960's America and we're committed to ensuring that those stories are told only by African-American presenting actors. Where there are specific cast requirements we have provided these in the 'Roles' section of our full audition notice. Where ethnicity and race is not intrinsically important to a character’s story, we are very open – and would actively encourage actors of all ethnicities to audition for those parts. 

If you are unsure about whether you should audition for a part, please do reach out to us at [violet@sedos.co.uk](mailto:violet@sedos.co.uk) to check! We will do our best to answer any questions you may have about getting involved.

You can read Sedos’s [Equality, Diversity and Inclusion policy in full here](https://www.sedos.co.uk/assets/policies/2023-12-edi-policy.pdf).

**WORKSHOP - Monday 4 November, 8pm-9.30pm**\
*Vibast Community Centre, 167 Old Street, EC1V 9NH*

Still not sure about auditioning? Do you want to find out more about our vision for the show or do you want to find out more about Sedos?

We'll be running a workshop to talk about the show, we'll sing through a musical number together and leave plenty of time for you to ask questions about the auditions. Workshops are a really good way to find out about Sedos and meet others who have done shows before, people who are new to the scene and to speak to the team on a very informal basis. Attending the workshop isn’t mandatory for auditions and won't have any effect on the casting process.
