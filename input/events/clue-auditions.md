Information has now been released about *[Clue](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2023-clue)* auditions.

**ABOUT THE SHOW**

Based on the iconic 1985 Paramount movie which was inspired by the classic Hasbro board game, *Clue* is a hilarious farce-meets-murder mystery. The tale begins at a remote mansion in 1954, where six mysterious guests – all with dastardly secrets of their own – assemble for an unusual dinner party where
murder and blackmail are on the menu. 

Their host, Mr Boddy, and his butler, Wadsworth, give each guest an alias – Colonel Mustard, Mrs. White, Mr. Green, Mrs. Peacock, Professor Plum, and Miss Scarlet.

Though discouraged from revealing personal information, it is soon discovered that while all of them are not exactly innocents themselves, they have fallen victim to the same blackmailer, their very host of the evening. Each guest is presented with a weapon and an option: pay their extortionist double or kill the
innocent butler. 

What follows is a madcap, slapstick evening full of murder, mystery, and laughs as they seek to puzzle out the culprit amongst criminals. Clue is the comedy whodunit that will leave both cult-fans and newcomers in stitches as they try to figure out...WHO did it, WHERE, and with WHAT!

**KEY DATES**

Auditions and most rehearsals will take place at Theatre Deli, 107 Leadenhall Street, London EC3A 4AF

**Auditions:** Thursday 6 and Saturday 8 July\
**Recalls:** Tuesday 11 July\
**Performances:** 26-30 September

Initial auditions will be in front of the director, assistant director, and an additional member of the production team. A member or representative of the Sedos Management Committee will also be on the panel to ensure fairness in auditions.

Auditions will take place in groups of 4-6 per 45 minute slot. Each auditionee will undertake a script reading with a member of the panel (separate to other auditionees) before coming together in a group to play some workshop style improvisation games. These will allow you to show us your acting range and how you respond to direction, as well as how you work in a group. With *Clue* being a heavily comedic, ensemble led show, we want to find people who are not afraid to be silly on stage and will support others through the process.

Once your audition has been confirmed, you will be sent the audition materials to prepare. We do not require that the material is memorised and you may look at the material in the audition, but the more prepared you are the easier it will be to show us your best performance. You will also be sent an audition form which must be filled out prior to auditioning, as well as an optional diversity monitoring form.

There is no fee to audition and you are not required to be a Sedos member to audition.

**[DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION](https://www.sedos.co.uk/about/diversity-and-inclusion) IN CASTING**

Sedos is committed to diversity and inclusion. Our commitment is to build and sustain a membership that is reflective of the diverse communities within London. We actively encourage all performers to audition for the roles which they feel best suit their skills.

With this production, we want to pay homage to the film, but we are not looking to copy it directly or cast ‘look-a-likes’ of the movie’s actors. With that in mind, we encourage auditionees to consider all parts, regardless of how these parts have previously been cast in either the film or the original board game. We have no preconceived ideas as to the ethnicity of any role and ethnicity will not be a factor in any casting choice.

Due to the nature of the performance rights, actors will need to portray the character in the genders written, however actors of all gender identities are very welcome to audition for any role. Giving an example here will help i.e. Ensemble Male is written as a male character and should be performed with masculine traits and as male-presenting, however, we welcome actors of any and no gender to audition for his part as long as they are comfortable playing a male character on stage.

We will consider performers with disabilities for any role and would actively encourage disabled performers to audition. If you have any access requirements for the audition process, rehearsal process, or performances, please let us know and we will endeavour to make reasonable adjustments. If you have any further queries around the production, please feel free to get in touch and will do our best to assist.

We are unable to cast anyone under the age of 18. Playing age of all characters is 18 - 60+.
