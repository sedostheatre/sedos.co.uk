**MONDAY 26 JULY 2021 | 7pm-9pm**\
**Part of the [Sedos Members' Week](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-welcome-back-members-week)**

**We’re back!!! Sedos is very excited to begin our in-person activities at the Bridewell Theatre with a chance for lots of people to get involved with the return of our Acting Group.**

The first event of our [Welcome Back Members’ Week](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-welcome-back-members-week) will be a friendly, relaxed and supportive atmosphere for people who want to act - whether they want to brush up on their skills, prepare for an audition or simply 'have a go'. All levels of ability are welcome, whether its your first time or your fiftieth time!

There's nothing to prepare. Bring yourself, a tea or coffee, and take a script to rehearse for an hour then we'll perform the scenes to the group at the end.

You can also bring your own script if you have a specific audition piece you want to try, or if you just really like the script! But please be aware we can’t guarantee all scripts will be used.

Scripts should be approx. 5 minutes (no longer than 8 minutes) and there will be a selection of 2-3 handers on the day to choose from (monologues are welcome too).

The group is free for members but please sign up by emailing Helena at [membership@sedos.co.uk](mailto:membership@sedos.co.uk) stating your name so we have an idea of numbers.

That's it! We won't reply unless you ask us a specific question.

Please note: numbers will be restricted to make sure we get through all the extracts in time, so please register ASAP. Participants will be allocated on a first come first serve basis.
