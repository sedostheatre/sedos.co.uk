**The London Acting Group run by Sedos takes place on the first Wednesday of every month.**

*Sessions take place at Theatre Deli Leadenhall Studios, 107 Leadenhall Street, London EC3A 4AF from 7-9pm.*

Sedos’ Acting Group is a friendly, relaxed and supportive atmosphere for people who want to act... whether you want to brush up on your skills, prepare for an audition or simply 'have a go', you are welcome! We tackle everything from contemporary to classical, comedy to drama, and everything in-between. We encourage all levels of ability to take part, it doesn’t matter whether it’s your first time acting or your 50th time! 

There’s nothing to prepare. Bring yourself, a tea or coffee, take a script to rehearse for an hour, and then we’ll perform the scenes to the group at the end. And of course there’s the non-obligatory trip to the pub afterwards. 

You can also bring your own script if you have a specific audition piece you want to try, or if you just really like the script! But please be aware we can’t guarantee all scripts will be used. 

Scripts should be approximately five minutes (no longer than eight minutes) and there will be a selection of 2-3 handers on the day to choose from (monologues are welcome too).

**There is a £5 payment for Sedos members and non-members alike at our London Acting Group.**

Please sign up by emailing Helena and Lloyd at [](mailto:[acting@sedos.co.uk](<>))[acting@sedos.co.uk](mailto:acting@sedos.co.uk) stating your name and any questions.

That's it! We will reply confirming the studio number at Theatre Deli a few days ahead of the group.
