Registrations are now open for our weekend musical of _Hairspray_.

The weekend musical is an opportunity to rehearse a show over one weekend (16-17 March), with a workshop-style performance at the end. The main aim of the weekend is to have fun! It's a chance to pack all the highs of doing a show into a 48-hour period and to give an opportunity to perform to people who might not be able to usually commit to a rehearsal period due to other commitments.

We will be auditioning for 10 named roles on the evening of Friday 15 March and you can sign up for an audition slot now. We are also taking registrations for the ensemble, which is open to everyone with no auditions.
