*We are excited to have secured the rights to the one act version of Moira Buffini's comedy, to be performed via Zoom at 7:30 on Thursday 26 November.*

Handbags, hairspray and sensible shoes.

The monarch - Liz.

Her most powerful subject - Maggie.

One believed there was no such thing as society. The other had vowed to serve it.

For over a decade, Margaret Thatcher met the Queen for a weekly audience. With all her previous Prime Ministers the Queen enjoyed a fairly informal relationship, but with Mrs Thatcher, things were different.

Moira Buffini's short play, *Handbagged*, speculates on the relationship between these two very powerful and private women.

The monologue isn't compulsory, but really does help us when it comes to casting if we haven't seen you act before.\

Please ensure that all applications reach us by 6pm on Wednesday 18 November. There will be one rehearsal at 7:30pm on Monday 23 November.

Note that this play is for 6 actors, so it is unlikely we will be able to cast all applicants. We are not planning to cast according to the ages of the characters.

We welcome an audience, so do feel free to join us on Thursday 26 November at 7:30pm. Please email [readings@sedos.co.uk](mailto:readings@sedos.co.uk) for the link. We look forward to seeing you there!
