**Sedos are proud to announce the second *Play in a Day* event for 2021, *DNA* by Dennis Kelly, which forms part of our *September Festival* (19-25 September 2021). We'll be rehearsing and performing a play in a single day on Saturday 25 September 2021**

The show requires actors to be available for just a single day, so it's the perfect way to get back on stage. Auditions are open to absolutely everyone, no matter your acting experience; those new to Sedos are especially welcome!

#### **Synopsis**

A group of teenagers commit a murder in the woods. As they panic, they begin to question their friendships, their loyalties, and even their own stories.

#### **What are we looking for**

The play is a **fast-paced ensemble show**. All of the parts have a significant amount of stage time, and the play relies on a powerful group energy which we'll be working on in rehearsals. The whole show is about 45 minutes with no interval.

We're looking to **cast eleven actors**, and we're looking for performers who can throw themselves into a busy day and bring a lot of energy and enthusiasm! No previous acting experience is required, and you should feel free to come along to the audition just to see what it's like.

See the audition notice for more details of the parts available. If you're cast, you will have to be available all day on the performance day, Saturday 25 September 2021. We'd also like actors to become familiar with the lines before the day, but we won't be expecting anyone to be completely off book.

#### **When and where are the auditions?**

I**n-person auditions will take place on Sunday 29 August 2021, from 9am to 2pm at BHG.**

Alternatively, you can audition by sending a video monologue to [playinaday@sedos.co.uk](mailto:playinaday@sedos.co.uk) before the end of Sunday 29 August 2021.

#### Casting, Equality, Inclusion and Diversity

Sedos seeks to build and sustain a membership that is reflective of the diverse communities within London. We actively encourage all performers of all ethnicity and genders to participate and audition for the roles which best suit their skills. Where any roles require specific characteristics, this is set out in the audition notice. For all other roles, we are open to and encourage diverse casting and we are excited to see what you can bring to the role.
