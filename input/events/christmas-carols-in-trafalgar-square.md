**Our much-loved annual Christmas carols in Trafalgar Square is back — and this year it’s set to be bigger and brighter than ever!** 

Beneath the glow of the world-famous Christmas tree, join singers, performers, and our festive friends from Centre Stage and Geoids for an afternoon of music, laughter, and holiday spirit — all in support of the British Heart Foundation.

We’re thrilled to welcome our friends from Quay Players, Cygnets Players and Mayhem Theatre Company, who’ll be joining us for the first time to create an even fuller, more joyful sound. The event will be conducted by Ollie Jones (assistant musical director on Sedos’ *The Pirate Queen*), bringing his prowess with the baton to this festive celebration. Together, we’ll fill the square with classic Christmas carols for everyone to enjoy.

The British Heart Foundation works tirelessly to fund pioneering research into heart and circulatory diseases — the UK’s biggest killers — and to support those affected by heart conditions. By joining us, you’ll not only be part of a wonderful community event but also helping raise awareness and support for this vital cause.

**Date:** Saturday 13 December\
**Time:** 1.30pm to sing 2-3pm\
**Where:** behind the Christmas tree, Trafalgar Square\
**Dress code:** wear festive red to spread the Christmas cheer
