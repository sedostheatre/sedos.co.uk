^^^ Sedos members, trustees and committee members at the 2022 AGM

**Save the date! The 2023 Sedos AGM will take place on Thursday 8 June.** 

Venue, timings and more information will be released nearer the time, but please put the date in your diary.

The AGM is your chance to hear about how the society is performing, and also to probe the management committee and the trustees on the way that the society is run!

Sedos is run primarily by two bodies: 

* A **Management Committee** that helps run the day-to-day (assists with selecting and putting on shows, making day-to-day payments and budgets, dealing with box office, organising member events etc.); and
* A **Board of Trustees** that supervises the Management Committee and makes overarching strategic and financial decisions (decides on policies and the overall direction of the society, administers special projects, considers and reacts to risks to the society etc.).

At the AGM a number of positions on both the Management Committee and the Board of Trustees will come up for election. We are always looking for new and diverse voices, different skill sets and people with the energy to take action on the behind-the-scenes administration of Sedos.

Given the current make-up of the Board of Trustees, in particular we are currently looking for:

* A greater degree of female and gender non-binary/fluid representation;
* A greater degree of representation of people of non-Caucasian background; and
* People with corporate fund-raising and charity governance experience.

In saying that, we would welcome people of all backgrounds and skill sets so long as you are willing to donate your time to making Sedos a better society for all its members.

As we run up to the election, you will start to see a lot more advertised about these positions and what they entail however if you canâ€™t wait to learn more, please contact Sedos Chair of the Board of Trustees, Daniel Saunders at [saunders@sedos.co.uk](mailto:saunders@sedos.co.uk).

We look forward to seeing you at the 2023 Sedos AGM.
