Registration is now open for *[Sunshine on Leith](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2023-sunshine-on-leith)* auditions.

**ABOUT THE SHOW**

**A jubilant, heartfelt musical about the power of home, the hearth, family and love featuring the songs of The Proclaimers.**\
\
*Sunshine on Leith* follows the highs and lows of Ally and his friend Davy as they search for normality after returning from a tour in Afghanistan. Families, friendships and life are not all plain sailing in this funny and moving story about love and life.\
\
Originally a stage musical before being transformed into the 2013 feature film adaptation, *Sunshine on Leith* will leave you asking: how many miles would you walk for the people and places you love?\
\
*Sunshine on Leith* is a vibrant, energetic piece of musical theatre, originally developed by the Dundee Rep Theatre and loved by audiences and critics alike.

**CONCEPT**

*Sunshine on Leith* is a show about the importance of connections with people and places, and we wish to emphasise this as much as possible within our production. Our production will remain true to focusing on the relationships between our characters first and foremost, utilising a multi-functional set, innovative lighting and sound design, a large, multi-roling ensemble, and the politically-charged songs of The Proclaimers to keep the triumphs and struggles of our characters and the people of Leith at the centre of the story.

**CASTING | DIVERSITY & INCLUSION**

Sedos is committed to diversity and inclusion. Our commitment is to build and sustain a membership that is reflective of the diverse communities within London. We actively encourage all performers to audition for the roles which they feel best suit their skills.\
\
We are seeking a diverse cast reflecting contemporary Scotland to take part in this production. We encourage auditionees to consider all parts, regardless of how these parts have previously been cast. \
\
For the nine named roles (seven principal, two featured ensemble) accents are required as listed against the character in the full audition notice. While we do not expect accents to be perfect at the audition stage, we require all performers to be willing to learn and perform the appropriate accents for each character to ensure that the cultural heritage of the show's location is respected.\
\
In addition, for the seven principal roles we will be aiming to cast age-appropriately to the ranges given.\
\
For principal roles, actors will need to play the character using the pronouns listed, however actors of all gender identities are very welcome to audition for any role. Please note that we are not able to transpose any vocal lines, and so would require performers to sing according to the vocal ranges listed for each role.\
\
We have no preconceived ideas as to the ethnicity of any role and ethnicity will not be a factor in any casting choice. \
\
We will consider performers with a disability for any role and would actively encourage disabled performers to audition. If you have any access requirements for the audition process, rehearsal process, or performances, please let us know and we will make any reasonable adjustments.  If you have any further queries around the production, please feel free to get in touch ([sunshine@sedos.co.uk](mailto:sunshine@sedos.co.uk)) and will do our best to assist.
