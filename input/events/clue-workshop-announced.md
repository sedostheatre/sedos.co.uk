**Follow the clues and discover the mysterious facts surrounding our September show, *Clue*, in a morning pre-audition workshop for the hilarious farce-meets-murder mystery on Saturday 3 June, 10.30am-12pm, at Theatre Deli.**

It’s a great way to uncover the truth about this comedy whodunit and meet the team – before the body count stacks up! WHO did it, WHERE, and with WHAT!

The tale begins at a remote mansion, where six mysterious guests - all with dastardly secrets of their own - assemble for an unusual dinner party where murder and blackmail are on the menu. When their host turns up dead, they all become suspects. Led by Wadsworth – the butler, Miss Scarlett, Professor Plum, Mrs. White, Mr. Green, Mrs. Peacock and Colonel Mustard race to find the killer as the body count stacks up.

*Clue* is based on the iconic 1985 Paramount movie which was inspired by the classic Hasbro board game.

Audition dates will be released soon!
