**Although melodramas had been staged for the majority of the nineteenth century, *The Lights o' London* by George R Sims went beyond much of the shallow characterisation and stock situations with its life-like characters and fast-moving plot.** 

The humour which runs through the play also stops it falling into sentimentality. As one of the travelling players says of his wife, "If you see her play Lady Macbeth, she's that natural ... the audience sometimes go out and fetch the police." 

George R Sims wrote his long-running romantic melodrama *The Lights o' London* for the newly rebuilt Royal Princess' Theatre, Oxford Street in 1881. The theatre was designed by C J Phipps, who followed it up with the new Savoy Theatre for Richard D'Oyly Carte. The actor manager at the Princess's was Wilson Barrett who, needless to say, cast himself in the romantic lead in *The Lights o' London.* 

The stage was equipped with all the latest machinery enabling swift scene changes from exterior of country mansion through a snow-covered road to London and a bridge over the canal basin in Regent's Park to a two-storey house in Borough Market, among others. Everything that a late Victorian theatre audience expected in this 2,000 seater theatre, and what modern day audiences expect from a cinema blockbuster. 

We have found that comedy, melodrama and a good storyline work best on the very small screen, so here is an opportunity to combine all three. Save the date, Thursday 18 March at 7.30pm.
