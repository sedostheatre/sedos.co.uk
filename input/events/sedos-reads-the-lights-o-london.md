**Although melodramas had been staged for the majority of the nineteenth century, *The Lights o' London* by George Sims went beyond much of the shallow characterisation and stock situations with its life-like characters and fast-moving plot.** 

The humour which runs through the play also stops it falling into sentimentality. As one of the travelling players says of his wife, "If you see her play Lady Macbeth, she's that natural... the audience sometimes go out and fetch the police." \
\
We have found that comedy, melodrama and a good storyline work best on the very small screen, so here is an opportunity to combine all three. Rehearsals will be on Tuesday 9, Thursday 11 and Tuesday 16 March all from 7-9pm. The performance is on Thursday 18 March at 7.30pm. \
