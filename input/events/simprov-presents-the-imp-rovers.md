**Simprov is back for another evening of improvised fun! Join us at the Bridewell for the culmination of our season's work as, for the first time ever, Simprov will be presenting a long-form improvised play.**

Our new class of improvisers, The Imp Rovers, will craft a 45 minute spectacular with brilliant characters, relationships and stories made up before your very eyes. 

Be prepared to laugh, cheer, and maybe even cry as the cast take you on a journey inspired by memories.
