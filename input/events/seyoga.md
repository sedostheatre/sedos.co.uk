**Connect with yourself on Wednesday evenings at 6.30pm.**

Yoga is a great way to move the body, connect with the mind and steady the breath.

So why not jump into an online class with Matt teaching and connect with other Sedosers every Wednesday night?

It's a 1-hour Vinyasa Flow class, followed by time to catch up with pals new and old if you want to.

Classes are free but please sign up in advance for each class through the link below.
