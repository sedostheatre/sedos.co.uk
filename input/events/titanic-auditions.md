Registration is now open for *Titanic* auditions.

**ABOUT THE SHOW**

Based on real people aboard the most legendary ship in the world, *[Titanic](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2023-titanic)* is a stunning and stirring production focusing on the hopes, dreams and aspirations of all on board. Through the eyes of architect Thomas Andrews, audiences are given a new perspective on this well known true story, showing the final hours of a group of the fateful ship’s passengers. All innocently unaware of the fate awaiting them, the Third Class passengers dream of a better life in America, the Second Class imagine they too can join the lifestyles of the rich and famous, whilst the millionaire Barons of the First Class anticipate legacies lasting forever.

**CONCEPT**

Whilst being terrified and excited in equal measure, we thought why not try the impossible? Maury Yeston’s score provides the most sweeping of melodies that we really believe will make music calls alone a glorious experience. We are so excited at the scope of the show and the chance to try and overcome some of the challenges it presents with an exciting company of performers (and if not, you will find us sobbing into a score of The Last Five Years wishing we had pitched differently).

We are looking to cast a large ensemble of performers in the show. Unlike a certain movie, the musical doesn't focus on a single pair of characters. In short, it's an ensemble piece where everybody has great moments in the proverbial spotlight. The cast will not only be imperative in capturing the many stories of those on board, but also in creating the action of the story. Given that the structure of the show is based on one character’s memories of the events, we hope to utilise stylised storytelling at points, to not only overcome the challenges of staging the sinking of the ‘ship of dreams’, but also create an exciting ensemble approach to the piece.

**CASTING | DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION** 

Sedos is committed to diversity and inclusion. Our commitment is to build and sustain a membership that is reflective of the diverse communities within London. We actively encourage all performers to audition for the roles which they feel best suit their skills. 

We are seeking a diverse cast to take part in this production. We encourage auditionees to consider all parts, regardless of how these parts have previously been cast. 

For some of the named roles accents are required as stated against the character, we however do not expect these to be perfect at the audition stage.

Actors of all gender identities are very welcome to audition for any role. Please note that we are not able to transpose any vocal lines, and so would require performers to sing in the original keys written in the score. We are also not able to modify any of the text of the libretto including to change genders and so you must be comfortable portraying these as written. 

We will consider performers with a disability for any role and would actively encourage disabled performers to audition. 

We have no preconceived ideas as to the ethnicity of any role and ethnicity will not be a factor in any casting choice.

Where an age range is listed in the character breakdown we will be aiming to cast age-appropriately. For any of the roles at auditions we are unable to cast anyone under the age of 18.

If you have any access requirements for the audition process, rehearsal process, or performances, please let us know and we will make any reasonable adjustments. If you have any further queries around the production, please feel free to get in touch (titanic@sedos.co.uk) and we will do our best to assist.
