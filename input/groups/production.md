**The Sedos production group is a resource for our production teams to ask for help, support and guidance with all things related to putting on a show.**

We have membership from across the range of different production roles and experiences, including lighting, sound, and set designers, directors, costumiers, and scenic carpenters.

This is also the first port of call for productions to find new team members and ask for involvement in set build days, get-ins and get-outs.

The production group meets regularly to discuss how current productions are going, any common issues that could be fixed by sharing knowledge, by making improvements in our environment or to our facilities.

The production group has a group on Facebook (just search "Sedos Production Group") and anyone asking to join it will be admitted, so do look us up if you are interested. For further information or just to get in touch please email [production@sedos.co.uk](mailto:production@sedos.co.uk)
