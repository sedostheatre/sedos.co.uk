The Sedos marketing group offers marketing support and advice to the production team of every Sedos show and also oversees general marketing of the society and our events.

The marketing group's remit includes areas such as the Sedos website and social media, the weekly newsletter and our intermittent mailings, brand guidelines, print publicity such as posters, flyers and programmes, and press releases.

The marketing group meets approximately every six to eight weeks and we are always pleased to welcome new members. Email [marketing@sedos.co.uk](marketing@sedos.co.uk) to contact the marketing group.
