**The Sedos membership group organise events for our members – and sometimes those who’d like to be involved who are not yet members – beyond our regular schedule of fully produced shows.**

These include workshops where you can learn new skills, socials, open mic nights, sing-a-longs and workshop-style productions such as Play in a Day or the Weekend Musical.

The membership group meet approximately every six to eight weeks and are always pleased to welcome new people to the group. Email [membership@sedos.co.uk](membership@sedos.co.uk) to contact the membership group.
