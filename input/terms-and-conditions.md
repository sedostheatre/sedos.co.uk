# Exchanges, Returns and Refunds

The box office for Sedos is operated on a voluntary basis, and as such, we can’t guarantee an instant response but will get back to you as quickly as we can on any queries to [tickets@sedos.co.uk](mailto:tickets@sedos.co.uk).

Where possible, we will exchange tickets for other nights of a given performance or other shows within the season. If there’s a difference in price, the discrepancy will need to be paid for or refunded to the original purchase method.

For most performances, refunds may be issued at the discretion of the box office team in exceptional circumstances. Where we have a reasonable expectation of being able to resell returned tickets (e.g. sold out performances) we may also offer refunds.

In addition to these points, our [data protection](https://www.sedos.co.uk/assets/policies/2021-06-privacy-and-data-protection-policy.pdf) policy is also in effect.
