## Seeing a Sedos show at the Bridewell Theatre

### Collecting tickets and entering the theatre

You will need to collect your tickets from the box office when you arrive at the theatre, giving the name the tickets were booked in. The box office opens approximately 45 minutes before curtain up.

The theatre is usually open for audience members to take their seats 10-15 minutes before curtain up. Our seat is unreserved, so audience members claim seats on a first-come, first-served basis. Some shows offer the best seats in the house as premium seating, at a higher price. In this case, there are two blocks of seating — standard and premium. Seats are unreserved within these blocks.

### Bar

The Bridewell bar is open approximately 45 minutes before performances, at the interval and after the show.

### Latecomers

In general, audience members arriving late for a Sedos show will be held outside the theatre until a suitable point for admission, when they will be show in by an usher or member of stage crew. You will be shown to the most easily accessible available seat so you will probably not be able to join your party if you arrive late.

Certain shows may not be able to admit latecomers at all or not until the interval, so you are advised to arrive in good time for curtain up.

### Accessibility

The Bridewell Theatre is accessible through the main entrance via a portable ramp over a threshold stone with a riser height ranging from 110-150mm from right to left. Access from the threshold to the auditorium is via a stairlift (230kg weight load) and to the theatre bar and lavatories via a platform lift (340kg weight load).
