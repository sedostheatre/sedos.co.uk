  ### About Sedos


  Sedos is a London amateur theatre company which produces [seven to 10 shows](https://sedos.co.uk/whats-on) every year. We have been the resident theatre company at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) (just off Fleet Street) since 2012 and most of our season takes place there. We also perform in other venues, including touring to the Edinburgh Festival and the Minack Theatre in Cornwall.


  We hold open [London auditions](https://sedos.co.uk/get-involved) for all our shows so both members and non-members can put themselves forward for roles. Additionally we have a thriving community of people who work behind the scenes on our productions in a wide variety of roles. 


  Sedos is proud to be a a founder member of [London Drama Societies](https://www.londondramasocieties.co.uk), which commits each member society to the following statement:


  “Collectively, we commit to take constant steps to be more inclusive and attract members and audiences reflecting London’s diversity.


  “We will identify and remove barriers to create a safe and inclusive environment. We want everyone to feel empowered to participate, on stage or off. We want stories to be told authentically.”
