We're delighted to announce the workshop and audition dates for our July musical, Stiles & Drewe's _Soho Cinders_.

When impoverished student Robbie becomes romantically involved with engaged Mayoral candidate James Prince, his lap-dancing step-sisters become the least of his problems! James and Robbie's worlds collide forcing them to fight for their own fairy-tale ending in this hilarious, satirical twist on the classic Cinderella story. 

The potent mix of politics, sex-scandals and true love come together in this contemporary musical with an infectious score that you'll be humming long past the stroke of midnight!

**WORKSHOP:** Thursday 21 March\
**AUDITIONS:** Friday 12 - Sunday 14 April \
**RECALLS:** Wednesday 17 April

Keep your eyes peeled for the full audition notice which will be released early March.
