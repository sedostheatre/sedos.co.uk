***The Color Purple* team have today launched an [expression of interest](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSercq4K4Zgq9G_Y6_i7qW6CXTJd3ahARNHke66Mv9ks7PLB4A/viewform) form where you can register an interest in auditioning for the show, being part of the backstage or creative team or being in the audience.** 

The Color Purple plays at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) from 20-30 November. Exact audition dates are still to be confirmed, but we will be hosting free pre-audition workshps on 18 May (north London) and 25 May (south London) – more detials on how to sign up soon. In the meantime, do fill in the form to [register your interest in auditioning or in backstage roles](https://forms.gle/Xs8xDapxMhkE9gyy7). 

**On stage roles** \
Please be aware that every character in *The Color Purple* is Black and in order to cast this production authentically, we will only be considering people from Black or mixed race ethnic groups for these roles.

**Gender**\
We’re happy to consider people of any gender identity. We’ve specified gendered ensembles as we’d like to be able to plan ahead **if** we need to recruit for a specific gender. There will be numbers in the show where you may be asked to portray a specific gender. Please select whatever role you’d feel most comfortable portraying – this doesn’t have to align with the gender you were assigned at birth. 

**Off stage roles**\
While we encourage people from Black and Minority Ethnic groups to take the opportunity to get involved with The Color Purple it's not a requirement that you are a Black or Minority Ethnic person in order to get involved with backstage roles for this production. 

**Creative roles**\
When it comes to hair, wigs, make-up and costume, we strongly encourage people from a Black ethnic group to get involved due to the subject matter of the show and the race of people we will be casting in the show. Other creative roles do not have a specific requirement to be from a certain ethnic group, but we still encourage people from a Black background to put themselves forward.
