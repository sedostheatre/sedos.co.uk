**Following [the death of Stephen Sondheim last Friday](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-59440642) (26 November), we decided to take a look back at Sedos’ relationship with the legendary composer.**

Sedos has staged eight productions of Sondheim musicals, making him our most performed author.

Our previous Sondheim shows are:

2005 – *Company*\
2006 – *Merrily We Roll Along*\
2007 – *Sweeney Todd*\
2011 – *[West Side Story](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2011-west-side-story)* (lyrics only)\
2011 – *[Assassins](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2011-assassins)*\
2011 – *[A Little Night Music](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2011-a-little-night-music)*\
2014 – *[Into the Woods](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2014-into-the-woods)*

In the programme for our 2014 production of *Into the Woods*, we ran a two-page feature celebrating Sedos’ previous Sondheim shows. We have dug it out of the archives for you to enjoy again here…
