*21 June 2024*

**Every Sedos show starts with an idea and a pitch, and we are now accepting pitch proposals for our 2025 season. Whether it’s a play or a musical, a beloved classic or something new and innovative, we want to hear your ideas!**

We have lots of resources and support available to anyone considering pitching a show:

* A [Pitch Guidance document](http://sedos.co.uk/pitch-guidance) with all the information you need to know about pitching a show for Sedos
* A [Pitch Library](http://sedos.co.uk/pitch-library) of past successful pitch application forms, to give you an idea of what we’re looking for in the submissions
* Free personalised pitch advice sessions to help you put together a well-considered pitch proposal - email [pitches@sedos.co.uk](mailto:pitches@sedos.co.uk) before 19 July to arrange a session

Once you have read the Pitch Guidance document in its entirety, you can download the [Pitch Application form](http://sedos.co.uk/pitch-form) and fill it out. Email the completed form along with any supporting documents to [pitches@sedos.co.uk](mailto:pitches@sedos.co.uk) before 10am on July 26th to ensure your pitch is considered.

The deadline for pitch submissions is 10am on 26 July.

Please note: we may ask you to come and share your vision with the Management Committee on Saturday 31 August, so please let us know if you are unavailable on this date. These meetings will be in person, however we are happy to meet you virtually if you are not able to attend in person.
