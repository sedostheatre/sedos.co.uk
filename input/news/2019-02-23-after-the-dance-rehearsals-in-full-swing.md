The cast and production team are bounding into spring as rehearsals for Sedos' production of _After the Dance_ are in full swing.

With the set fully designed and stocked with a vintage collection of decanters that even Bette Davis would be proud of, the cast and crew of _After the Dance_ have begun sipping down the rich, dry world of Terence Rattigan's pre World War Two play for performances 9-13 April at the Bridewell Theatre.

Following a successful round of auditions at the end of 2018, the cast of over thirteen have begun rehearsals at 1BHG. Directors Jon Foster and Chloe Baker have been focusing on the tragic comedy of Terence Rattigan's desperate characters and the cutting wit that underlines their peppery dialogue, all set within a Mayfair flat during a time where the country's future is uncertain.

Music and disasters inspired by the cast's own party experiences have been used to explore what makes our very best, and very worst, parties. Costumes are being designed and the whole team is ready to inject the play with all the chaos, clamour and glamour of a post-flapper lifestyle.  

WHEN: 9-13 April, 7.30pm, with 2.30pm Saturday matinee\
WHERE: Bridewell Theatre, Bride Lane, London, EC4Y 8EQ
