**Sedos' Chair, Dawn Harrison-Wallace, was one of 68 signatories in a recent letter to The Times calling for immediate support for the arts.**

Writing in her role of Chair of Half Moon Theatre, one of Sedos' previous Charity of the Year beneficiaries, she was calling on people to write to their MPs and "join our fight for the survival of UK theatre". 

Theatres, music venues and arts companies are on the brink of ruin. If you care about saving the arts in the UK - and we know you do, or you wouldn't be reading this - please consider joining the **[Public Campaign for the Arts](https://www.campaignforthearts.org/)**, signing the survey and writing to your MP - there are templates on their website.

In 10 days they received 70,000 signatures and it's still growing. Please sign the petition and tell us why you would want to keep the arts. We are stronger together.
