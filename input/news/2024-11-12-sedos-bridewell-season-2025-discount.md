**Plan your theatre trips for 2025 – and receive a special discount.**

We are delighted to offer our most loyal audience members a special discount when you book our [2025 shows](https://www.sedos.co.uk/whats-on) at the [Bridewell Theatre](https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/bridewell) . 

If you book any four (or more) shows in our 2025 Bridewell season in one transaction, you will receive 25% off. The discount will be applied automatically at the [online box office](https://sedos.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows). 

The discount allows you to indulge your musical desires by booking all four of Sedos’ 2025 London musicals – or perhaps you like to mix plays and musicals? Of course, by booking early you not only receive 25% off, you also have the best choice of seats so you can be sure of securing your favourite spot. 

Unfortunately there seems to be a gremlin in the box office system which means the multi-buy discount is not being automatically applied when combined with our standard Sedos membership ticket discount. To receive the discount, members should therefore make a booking for four (or more) shows online in a single transaction, then forward your confirmation email to [tickets@sedos.co.uk](mailto:tickets@sedos.co.uk) and we will organise you a refund of the relevant amount so that the discount is applied.
