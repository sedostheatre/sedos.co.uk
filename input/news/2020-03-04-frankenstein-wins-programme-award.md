**Great news from the recent NODA AGM. Sedos was a winner in September 2018's National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) AGM!** 

Our 2017 production of *Frankenstein* won the national award for standard class programmes. Congratulations to Pippa Kyle and Stephen Beeny, who designed the programme, and the whole *Frankenstein* team.
