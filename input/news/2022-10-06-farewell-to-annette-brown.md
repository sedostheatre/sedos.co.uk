*Thursday 6 October 2022*

**We have lost a much-loved member of the Sedos community this week - Annette (“Netty”) Brown passed away on Monday 3 October.**

Netty played the trumpet on a number of Sedos shows including *Kiss of the Spider Woman: The Musical* but perhaps most memorably was part of our troupe that performed *A Swell Party* at the Minack Theatre in Cornwall a few years ago. Her rendition of Blow Gabriel Blow was a moment of pure joy.

Netty was a larger than life character who always brought joy and laughter to everyone she came into contact with. She will be very much missed but never forgotten.
