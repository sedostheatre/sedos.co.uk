“Now is the winter of our discontent. Made glorious summer by this sun of York.” 



Young Richard of Gloucester begins his unscrupulous climb to the top. But how does such a tyrant get away with his actions and how can he be stopped? Bringing the story to the modern day Conservative Party during the 2019 Leadership Election, the parallels drawn in this innovative production of Richard III will bring the story closer to home than ever before.
