*3 July 2024*

**Thank you so much to everyone who marched with us at Pride in London on Saturday 29 June.** 

We had a fantastic day in the sunshine celebrating and showing our pride with friends from [Geoids](https://www.geoidsmt.co.uk/) and [Centre Stage](https://www.centrestage.london/) under the banner of [London Drama Societies](https://www.instagram.com/londondramasocieties/), including a big group rendition of Seasons of Love, no less.

A huge thanks to the helpers from all three societies who helped to make it happen, and we can't wait to do it all again next year.

This is the fourth year Sedos has marched at Pride. We [first joined the parade in 2019](https://www.sedos.co.uk/news/2020-03-04-sedos-marches-at-pride) – linked to our production of *[Soho Cinders](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2019-soho-cinders)* – and then marched again as a solo society in 2022. In 2023, we joined up with Geoids and Centre Stage to take part under the London Drama Societies umbrella.
