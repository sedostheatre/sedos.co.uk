*3 July 2024*

**Thank you so much to everyone who marched with us at Pride in London on Saturday 29 June.**

We had a fantastic day in the sunshine celebrating and showing our pride with friends from [Geoids](https://www.geoidsmt.co.uk/) and [Centre Stage](https://www.centrestage.london/), under the banner of [London Drama Societies](https://www.instagram.com/londondramasocieties/). 

This is the fourth year Sedos has marched at Pride. We [first joined the parade in 2019](https://www.sedos.co.uk/news/2020-03-04-sedos-marches-at-pride) – linked to our production of *[Soho Cinders](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2019-soho-cinders)* – and then marched again as a solo society in 2022. In 2023, we joined up with Geoids and Centre Stage to march together under the umbrella of London Drama Societies, united by a commitment to entrench diversity and inclusion in our society values, audition processes, and casting of our productions. 

We had an amazing time this year, and thank you to everyone who joined us! As well as a big group rendition of Seasons of Love and some brilliant flag-ography, we shouted our message loud and clear - amateur theatre is for everyone. 

The membership group would like to thank all of the committee members and volunteers from all three societies who helped to make the day happen, as well as those who came along to support us and offer hugs and cheers along the route! We are already planning for next year, so watch this space for your opportunity to join us marching at Pride in 2025…

If you would like to be involved in the organisation of events and opportunities for Sedos members, we would love to hear from you! Please contact [membership@sedos.co.uk](mailto:membership@sedos.co.uk) for more information.
