**Some of the team behind our 2020 show, *[The Musicals of Musicals (The Musical)](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2020-the-musical-of-musicals-the-musical)*, reflect on some of the things they miss about not being able to perform at the moment. As it turns out, the February production was the only show that Sedos performed in 2020!**

Thanks to Emma J Leaver, the director of "Musicals", for editing the video and to everyone who took part in it. What do you miss about amateur theatre and not being able to perform, create or work backstage on a show?
