*1 November 2024*

**We're delighted to announce that we will be touring *[The Pirate Queen](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2025-the-pirate-queen?mc_cid=bb0685c724&mc_eid=UNIQID)* to the [Minack Theatre](https://minack.com/) in Cornwall next summer.**\
\
From Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil – the writers of *Les Misérables* and *Miss Saigon* – *The Pirate Queen* is an epic musical adventure which celebrates legendary Irish chieftain Grace O’Malley and asks how far you’d go to protect what you love.\
\
Director Katie Porter said: "It’s always exciting to see shows where women are in positions of power and have struggled to overcome the limitations placed on them by society. As an Irish woman, it is doubly exciting to have a show steeped in Irish history and culture and I’m thrilled to bring that to the Cornish coast at the Minack with Sedos next summer."\
\
This is the second time Sedos has had an opportunity to tour a show to the Minack Theatre, one of the most beautiful open-air theatres in the world, and we’re looking for a big, diverse cast to share this exciting experience (show week 28 June-4 July). Auditions will be held in February and the full audition notice will be released in due course.

Katie is joined on *The Pirate Queen* creative team by musical director Oscar Denihan, also musical director of our 2023 production of *[Sunshine on Leith](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2023-sunshine-on-leith)*, and experienced producers Lizzie Levett and Pippa Kyle.
