**To acknowledge World AIDS Day we’re releasing the new artwork for our July play, *[Love! Valour! Compassion](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-love-valour-compassion)!*** 

Wednesday 1 December is World AIDS Day, as we mourn those we’ve lost, stand in solidarity with those living with HIV, and raise awareness as we hope for an end to new cases.

The Sedos production of *Love! Valour! Compassion!*, a play about the lives of 8 gay men over 3 holiday weekends in the countryside of Long Island, was originally scheduled for July 2020.  This play, by Terrence McNally, looks at their romantic and fraternal relationships, with the AIDS epidemic as an ever-present weight on each character.

Now planned for July 2022, production will be recommencing over the next few months, with the audition notice published by the end of the year.
