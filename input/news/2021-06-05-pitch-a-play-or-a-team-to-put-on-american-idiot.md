*XX MONTH 2021 - DATE OF GOING LIVE HERE IN ITALICS PLEASE*

**In order to complete our 2022 season, [the management committee are seeking pitches](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bbhThOKhturIFEobrTp9vBK1r2TMBs0MuZErDPAcObo/edit#) in two different areas.** 

Firstly, we would like to hear pitches for a play to be performed at the Bridewell Theatre from 22-26 February 2022.

Secondly, we want to hear from teams who would like to bring to life *American Idiot*, a musical which we have secured the rights to stage at the Bridewell from 10-14 May 2022.

Full details about both pitch processes and the form to fill in can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bbhThOKhturIFEobrTp9vBK1r2TMBs0MuZErDPAcObo/edit#). 

We’d love to receive pitches from anyone who wants to apply, no matter their background. We are proud of our reputation for high quality productions and therefore do take into consideration experience, but that doesn’t have to be with Sedos and we have regularly given shows to those new to the society. 

As a society, we are committed to being as inclusive as possible and therefore are looking for a truly diverse range of people to come forward to be involved both on stage and off. 

The deadline for pitches is midnight on Sunday 25 July. 

If you have any questions, contact [pitches@sedos.co.uk](mailto:pitches@sedos.co.uk)
