We have great pleasure in announcing that Sedos is the winner of the Whitebread Trophy award for Programme Design (Standard Class) for *Frankenstein*. Huge congratulations to Pippa Kyle and Stephen Beeny, who created the award-winning programme.

The 16-page, large format square programme featured photography by David Ovenden, an interesting article by *Frankenstein'*s director Matt Gould, cast and creative team biogs alongside information on Sedos, the Bridewell Theatre and Noda itself.

The award was revealed at the NODA London Festival Weekend on 24 June, where we were also highly commended for the Dumayne Warne Trophy for Poster Design for*Frankenstein*, which had a design by Stephen Beeny.

Congratulations one and all!
