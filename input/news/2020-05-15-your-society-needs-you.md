At the forthcoming AGM on Thursday 4 June, there will be a number of vacancies on the Sedos Board of Trustees and also on the Management Committee.

The Board of Trustees' primary responsibility is to ensure the long-term financial health of the society together with ensuring compliance with laws, regulations and financial reporting obligations.

The Management Committee is responsible for the day-to-day running and management of the society, under the oversight of the Board of Trustees.

### **Trustee Elections**

Under the terms of the Society's constitution, a number of the current Trustees will be standing for re-election, and a small number of Trustees have indicated that they will be standing down. So if you would be interested in becoming a Trustee, please contact Alex Baker, Secretary of the Board of Trustees at alexanderjbaker@gmail.com for more information.

Applications to become a Trustee need to be submitted by Friday 1 May 2020 with a short written statement indicating your desire to stand along with a short written statement explaining why you are interested in becoming a Trustee of Sedos, and the skills and experience you would bring to the role.

Further details, particularly around becoming a Trustee and the responsibilities that that entails are included in the attached memorandum.

### **Management Committee Elections**

Under the terms of reference of the Management Committee, half of the current members will be seeking re-election; a small number of the current members of the Management Committee have indicated that they are intending to step down so there will be certainly be vacancies that we are looking to fill. In the event that more people are interested in becoming members of the management committee than there are vacancies, there will be a vote.

In order to reflect the diversity of the membership within the Management Committee to ensure that we properly reflect the full breadth of our members, we would be particularly keen on members who direct and perform - and in particular those who are focussed on plays! In addition, we would be keen on members who are interested in assisting with the day-to-day administration of the society, for example looking after BHG, sorting rehearsal rooms, keeping an eye on the costume/props etc.

If you would like to consider becoming a member of the Management Committee, please contact the Chair: Matt Gould, at matt@mjgould.co.uk. Applications to become a member of the Management Committee need to be submitted by 1 May 2020 with a short statement indicating your desire to stand and the skills and experience you would bring to the role.
