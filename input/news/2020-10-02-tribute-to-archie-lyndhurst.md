**We were extremely sad to hear the news this week that Archie Lyndhurst has died, aged 19, after a short illness.**

Archie was one of the actors who played the boy in Sedos' 2011 production of *Assassins*.

The son of *Only Fools and Horses* actor Nicholas Lyndhurst, Archie was best known for playing Ollie Coulton in the comedy series *So Awkward*.

Maria Waters, director of *Assassins*, said: "Archie was a gorgeous boy, full of joy and enthusiasm and he loved all things theatrical. It was no surprise at all that he followed his dad and went on to a successful TV career as he was a natural comedy actor. I saw him at an RSC event last year and he was still just as sweet and talked fondly of his 'first job' in our production. His parents were incredibly supportive of him and came to every performance so my heart is breaking for them."
