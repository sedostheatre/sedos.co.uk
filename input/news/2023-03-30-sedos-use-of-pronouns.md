  International Transgender Day of Visibility
---
*30 March 2022*

**We want to make sure Sedos continues to be a safe, inclusive, diverse and respectful place for all our members and friends. To mark International Transgender Day of Visibility (31 March) our Trustees and Management Committee have added their pronouns to the website.** 

It is a small but easy way to be more inclusive and normalise discussions surrounding gender. In particular, it allows transgender and non-binary people to let others know which pronouns they’d like to be used, and therefore avoids them being misgendered. 

Going forward we will be encouraging production teams to include pronouns on show pages, audition notices, cast reveals, and programmes. It is a personal choice whether or not to use pronouns and we will never force anyone to share theirs if they don’t feel able, safe, or ready to do so. If someone lets you know the pronouns they’d like you to use to refer to them, please be respectful of this. And if you’re unsure when you first meet someone, it’s ok to ask.
