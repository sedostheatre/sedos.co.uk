*28 July 2021*

**We’ve thrilled to announce the new cast of *Ophelia Thinks Harder*, our first full production at the Bridewell Theatre for 18 months!** 

The show, a riotous reworking of Shakespeare's *Hamlet* from a feminist perspective, was supposed to be performed back in April 2020, but world events got in the way and the show was postponed, until now. 

Unfortunately, some of the original company were unable to perform on the rescheduled dates, so we’re delighted to welcome six new cast members  to the team. 

The *Ophelia Thinks Harder* production team would like to thank everyone who took the time to audition. The standard was extremely high and the production team had some difficult casting decisions to make. 

We’re delighted to announce the cast of *Ophelia Thinks Harder*:

**OPHELIA** | Natalie Harding-Moore\
**MAID** | Heather Daniel\
**QUEEN** | Danielle Capretti\
**ROSENCRANTZ** | Emily Bates\
**GUILDENSTERN** | Josie Teale\
