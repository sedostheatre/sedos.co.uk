Did you know that the "Theo ending" which is now widely used in productions of _Pippin_ was first conceived at the Bridewell Theatre exactly 20 years ago?

Stephen Schwartz, the writer of Pippin's music and lyrics, was in London in the spring of 1998 when a group performing the show at the Bridewell, led by director and choreographer Mitch Sebastian, asked permission to change the ending in order to allow Theo to be played by a teenager rather than three children being required to meet licensing requirements.

We won’t give away what happens — you’ll have to come to our production in May — but Schwartz believed that Bob Fosse, the original Broadway director and choreographer who died in 1987, would have “loved” the new ending, which he described as “dark in a wonderful way”. The Theo ending was used in the 2013 Broadway revival, which won four Tony Awards.

Mitch Sebastian also directed and choreographed the Menier Chocolate Factory production of Pippin in 2011, which was set in the world of video games.
