metaDescription: Audiences at Sedos’ production of Carrie gave £1000 for the
  charity Bloody Good Period
---
**Last week Carrie became Sedos’ best selling one week show on record and thanks to the generosity of our audiences, we raised just over £1000 for Bloody Good Period.**

This charity, which the cast and team chose to support given the themes raised in the show, gives period products to those who can’t afford them, and provides menstrual education to those less likely to access it.

£1000 is enough to

* make 50 bulk deliveries of period products, or
* fund 2 menstrual health education sessions for refugees and asylum seekers, or
* provide 20 full sets of reusable period products
