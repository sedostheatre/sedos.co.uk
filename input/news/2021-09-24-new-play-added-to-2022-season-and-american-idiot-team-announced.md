**NEW PLAY ADDED TO 2022 SEASON**

We’re thrilled to announce a new play for our 2022 season. *[When the Rain Stops Falling](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-when-the-rain-stops-falling)*, by Andrew Bovell, is a beautiful and expansive drama spanning four generations and two continents, from a claustrophobic London flat in 1959 to the windswept southern coast of Australia in 2039. All throughout 80 years of torrential rain.  It sees a series of interwoven stories come together, as seven people confront the mysteries of their past, revealing how patterns of betrayal, love and abandonment are passed on.

The play is directed by Helena Bumpus, with Assistant Direction from Lloyd Smith, Movement by Kim Barker, Costumes by Wing-Ho Lin and Lighting by Olly Levett. It will be performed at the Bridewell Theatre in February 2022.

In-person auditions will be held on Saturday 23 Oct and Monday 25 October (video auditions also accepted), and slots can be booked online at membership.sedos.co.uk with more information on our website.
