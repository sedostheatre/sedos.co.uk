*23 May 2024*

**We’re back again this year, marching alongside our friends at Centre Stage and Geoids in the London Pride Parade on Saturday 29 June under the London Drama Societies banner.**

London Drama Societies was established in 2020 as a way to unite central London’s most popular amateur theatre groups under the united cause of making constant steps to improve diversity, equality and inclusion within our communities.

Pride in London is a fantastic opportunity to maximise visibility, to show unity, and to promote equality – something that Sedos wholly believes is the way forward to reflect and encourage diversity in our membership. 

As part of this commitment, all of the societies have agreed to make this a completely free event for our members so that everyone feels able to participate. We’ve got 50 places up for grabs across all three societies on a first come first served basis, you just need to be a member of one of the three societies to join us.
