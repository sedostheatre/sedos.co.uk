**Today, Tuesday 7 July 2020, should have been the opening night for Sedos' production of *Love! Valour! Compassion!*, by Terence McNally. The show should also have been part of the London Pride Parade.** 

Winner of the 1995 Tony Award for Best Play, it's a monumental exploration into life, love and loss at the end of the millennium. As hilarious as it is heart-breaking, McNally's seminal work captures the zeitgeist of 90s America and forces the question - when reality hits home, who and what is most important to us?

Whilst we're devastated not to meet eight friends as they vacation over three long weekends, let's keep fingers crossed that we can catch up with them soon.
