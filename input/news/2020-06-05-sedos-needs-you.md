**Stay connected as we all stay apart!**

We are very keen to remain engaged with all of our members and friends during this time of lock-down. Isolation is already going great guns, thanks to everyone who has emailed and got involved. 

The Banana Hut Gang continue to practice their improvisation skills using Zoom and Tom Leonard lead our first virtual Sedance this week.

The Member's Group are pulling together some more organised fun - they are meeting this weekend so if you have any immediate thoughts or suggestions, please contact socials@sedos.co.uk.

We know a number of you are organising events already - we have a subscription to Google Meet (which is like an industrial version of Zoom) so if you would like to use this for a member's event and want more details, please contact Olly Levett at olly@sedos.co.uk.  

If you are organising anything and want to contact the wider membership, then please do use the newsletter and facebook in the usual way to contact as many members as possible. Email marketing@sedos.co.uk for help.

Please look out for each other - and stay connected!
