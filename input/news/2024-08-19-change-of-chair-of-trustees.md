*19 August 2024*

**At the last Trustee meeting, Dan Saunders announced that he had decided to step down as a Trustee and chair of Trustees.   Dan has recently been appointed a Trustee of the London Musical Theatre Orchestra and together with work commitments and his desire to spend more time contributing directly to our productions (both on and offstage) has decided that now is the right time to step back from his role as a Trustee.**

Dan joined the Trustees in 2020 and took on the role of chair in 2022. He has led the society through the transition caused by losing our home at Brewers’ Hall Garden and focused on the rethinking of our long-term strategy without a base. Dan has been extremely hard working at trying to find alternative homes for us, and he is going to continue to do that.  

Dan has worked with the Management Committee and production group to significantly reduce our storage and related costs, including a very memorable trip from London to Leeds to Ashwell, and having to take the tough decisions as to what of our stuff should be kept and what sadly had to go…

He has instilled a financial discipline on the Trustees and the Management Committee to make sure that, despite the loss of BHG, our finances are under control and we are limiting our reliance on our reserves to ensure the longevity of the society.

The remaining Trustees would like to extend a huge thank you to Dan for his time as a Trustee and as Chair. And of course, while a Trustee, Dan still found time to perform, including as Captain Smith in *[Titanic](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2023-titanic)*, Toby in *[The Effect](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2023-the-effect)* and Durdles in *[The Mystery of Edwin Drood](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-the-mystery-of-edwin-drood)*. He also recently put his design talents to great use in *[Just So](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2024-just-so)* and will shortly be seen on the Bridewell stage in *\[BLANK]*!  

Jack Brown has also decided to step down as a Trustee due to time commitments. While a Trustee, Jack has been instrumental in looking after the society's investments as well as leading the project to develop the Sedos Values.  

Dan and Jack’s support and counsel will be missed, but we are delighted that that they will both continue to be very active members of the society.

The remaining Trustees elected Matt Gould as the new chair. We wish Matt all success in this role.
