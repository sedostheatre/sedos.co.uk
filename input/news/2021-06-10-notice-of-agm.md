*6 June 2021*\
\
**As a reminder, the Sedos AGM will take place from 7.30pm on Thursday 24 June 2021.** \
\
We are hoping to be able to hold the AGM in person at the St Brides Foundation and simulcasting online, although these plans are dependent on a change in COVID-19 regulations on 21 June 2021.\
\
The AGM is your chance to hear about how the society is performing, and also to probe the Management Committee and the Trustees on the way that the society is run!\
\
Members will also be able to vote in the election of Trustees, and confirm the membership of the Management Committee for the year ahead.\
\
More information about the meeting and how the society has performed in the last year - including the AGM agenda, Trustee's report, financial accounts, and election notices - is included in the [document linked here](https://sedos.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f11e7310e7d52fc55e150f9dd&id=ea01a57f2a&e=74edd08618).\
\

We will look forward to seeing you there!\
