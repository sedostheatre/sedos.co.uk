**What is *[Sunday in Park with George](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2024-sunday-in-the-park-with-george)* about? The show imagines the life French, post impressionist painter, Georges Seurat. Little is known of the artist and so the story is almost entirely fictional.**

It focuses on his most famous work, A Sunday Afternoon On The Island Of La Grande Jatte, bringing to life each of the characters in his painting. 

Seurat developed pointillism, the technique of of painting in which small distinct dots of colour are applied in patterns to form an image. 

The original show opened on Broadway 40 years ago starring Bernadette peters and Mandy Patinkin. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Sondheim considered the show to be ‘closest to his heart’. 

**ACT 1**

In 1884, immersed in his studio, eccentric  artist Georges, attempts to capture the characters he sees around him through pointed spots of colour, much to the bemusement of local critics.

**ACT 2**

100 years later history repeats itself when his great-grandson, George, reveals his latest artwork, Chromolume #7 , to mixed reviews. Is his career finished? Or can his beloved muse , Dot, bring him to life as he did her? 

Our London run transforms a Grade 2 listed church building into Georges Paris studio, while our Suffolk run places the show right in the heart of the park on a Sunday. The audience will be immersed in George’s painting, surrounded by his work. 

*Sunday in the Park with George* explores love, loss, and what it means to sacrifice ones self for art. Starting with a white, blank canvas, and ending in technicolour, this show is one not to be missed and promises to be something truly magical.
