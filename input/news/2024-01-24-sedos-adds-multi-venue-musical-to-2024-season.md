*24 January 2024*

**An extra show has been added to the 2024 Sedos season – Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine’s masterpiece *[Sunday in the Park with George](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2024-sunday-in-the-park-with-george)* will have a 10-day run at [Wheatsheaf Hall](https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/wheatsheaf-hall) in Vauxhall (20-30 June) and two outdoor performances at [Thorington Theatre](https://www.thoringtontheatre.co.uk) in Suffolk (28 July and 4 August).** 

The Sunday team is headed up by experienced director and designer Robert J. Stanex and producer Rebecca Chisholm with support from Isaac Bartels (musical director), Kimberly Barker (musical director), Deborah Lean (costumier), Olivier Namet (assistant director) and Matthew Ferris (scenic carpenter). 

The pre-audition workshop will be on 7 February and auditions are 4-9 March, with recalls on 16 March. Registration for the workshop will open later this week. 

Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, *Sunday In The Park With George* merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. 

One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.

The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat’s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat’s descendant - named George and also an artist – finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.
