*6 August 2021*

**A huge thank you to everyone who came along to our celebration of theatre last week – our first live, in-person activities for 16 months! We hope you enjoyed our Welcome Back Members' Week and it was fantastic to see lots of non-members enjoying themselves – everyone was very welcome.**

We started the week with our Acting Group; giggled with our improv troupe the Banana Hug Gang (who sang opera and proved that you should never invite a psychopathic serial killer into your existential clown farce road movie!); sang our hearts out and chatted with friends at the Piano Night; and enjoyed sword fighting and melodrama with *The Corsican Brothers*, our Play in a Day. What a week!

Look out for some exciting news next week about more activities to get involved with.
