Our next rehearsed reading is kicking off, and we need you!

Following the success of *The Importance of Being Earnest*, we're pleased to announce that our next online performance will be *The Lieutenant of Inishmore* by Martin McDonagh.

Obviously these days we can't run a proper in-person audition process! But in order to open it up to people who may not have performed with Sedos before, we'd like anyone interested to submit a mini audition video - just one minute or less of you performing a monologue of any sort on your webcam or phone camera. 

Check out the **[audition notice](https://files.constantcontact.com/c1bb0b81101/307f91b2-3869-4c5d-9db2-0ad5c077cc12.pdf)** for details. It's very informal, so if you're interested then get recording!

Send audition videos and any questions to us at events@sedos.co.uk. 

The performance itself will take place in the last weekend of May, so watch this space for details of how you can watch!
