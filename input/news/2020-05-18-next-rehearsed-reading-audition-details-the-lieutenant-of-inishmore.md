Our next rehearsed reading is kicking off, and we need you!

Following the success of *The Importance of Being Earnest*, we're pleased to announce that our next online performance will be *The Lieutenant of Inishmore* by Martin McDonagh.

Obviously these days we can't run a proper in-person audition process! But in order to open it up to people who may not have performed with Sedos before, we'd like anyone interested to submit a mini audition video - just one minute or less of you performing a monologue of any sort on your webcam or phone camera. 

Check out the attached audition notice for details. It's very informal, so if you're interested then get recording!

Send audition videos and any questions to us at events@sedos.co.uk. 

The performance itself will take place in the last weekend of May, so watch this space for details of how you can watch!
