It's here! We're so excited to bring you the trailer for upcoming dive-bar musical, _Next Thing You Know_. We had so much fun shooting it, and we can't wait to welcome you to our bar, Sully's, in person. With less than two weeks to go, Thursday and Friday in particular are looking very tight on the ticket front, so you'll need to book now to avoid missing last orders...

Huge thanks once again to Slim Jim's in Islington for lending us their bar for the weekend whilst our own was being built. Check them out for a flavour of what awaits at the Bridewell!
