**Following the [publication of our Commitment to Change,](https://sedos.co.uk/news/2020-06-17-black-lives-matter---taking-action) the Action Group met virtually for the first time on 1 July 2020.**

In a frank and stimulating discussion, Sedos members met with representatives of Centre Stage and Geoids to agree how we can all take forward an agenda to make London amdram truly more diverse and inclusive.

Next weekend the Action Group we will be conducting Sedos' first hackathon to lock down what we're agreeing to achieve and how. We're really keen to give all members a voice in this, so if you would like to join the Action Group or would like to raise any issues with us, please email mailto:equality@sedos.co.uk.
