As part of Sedos' roadmap out of lockdown as published last week, we would love to schedule a big, fun, uplifting musical for two weeks this November or maybe a one-week musical from those currently on hold, plus a big, comedy play – if you have a suggestion and are interested in directing or otherwise being involved, email [committee@sedos.co.uk](mailto:committee@sedos.co.uk)
