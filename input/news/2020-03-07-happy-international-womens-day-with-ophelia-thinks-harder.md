On Sunday (8 March 2020), as the world celebrates International Women's Day, the Ophelia team will be rehearsing their feminist take on *Hamlet*.

Although *Ophelia Thinks Harder* was written over 25 years ago, its messages on the representation and treatment of women are still scarily relevant. Yes, it's a comedy, but it has some very pertinent things to say. On International Women's Day, we wanted to draw your attention to a few facts about women in theatre.

A survey by theatre company iN BLOOM in 2017 showed that 87% of women in theatre feel under represented. The statistics show they're not wrong. According to a study by UK arts data experts Purple Seven in 2018 (based on 2012-2015 data):

* Female customers account for 65% of ticket revenue, but only 39% of actors, 36% of directors and 28% of writers of plays performed are women.
* Male playwrights write 37% of parts for women, while female playwrights write for 60% female casts.
* Critics award more 4 and 5 star ratings to plays with casts of their own gender.
* Male directors and writers command bigger stages and higher ticket prices.
* The proportion of female directors has increased by 5% since 2012
