**After 14 long months the Sedos management committee finally got together for an in-person meeting this week – do you recognise the location*?**

To add to the occasion, it was the first time that Mark and Peter, who both joined the management committee during lockdown, had attended a ‘live’ meeting.

The get-together was an important first step towards Sedos opening up and there were a lot of exciting plans to discuss and firm-up – watch this space, there’s a lot going on behind the scenes and we can’t wait to share it all with you.

*\*Did you guess where they were? They sat on one of the long tables at the appropriately named Understudy bar, outside the National Theatre on the South Bank.*
