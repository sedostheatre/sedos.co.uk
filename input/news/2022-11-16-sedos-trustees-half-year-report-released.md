**MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRPERSON**

Welcome to the report that tells you everything you need to know about behind-the-scenes of the behind-the-scenes of Sedos!

Every year at the AGM (usually held in June) the Sedos Board of Trustees report back on the year that has been and the plans for the year to come. For those that attend, it is a chance to hear about all of the goings on of the administration and long term plans for Sedos. 

The 2022 Chairperson’s AGM report is reflected in the minutes of that meeting (which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13fa6XEho_8j5tAyxQX0wwuJ5HXOcRmjZ)), however, we are aware that not all members can attend the AGM and also that to wait a full year for another update from the Board of Trustees is a long time between drinks. 

Therefore, welcome to the Sedos Board of Trustee’s Half-Year Report. Hopefully this report provides all members a good idea of all of the non-show related plans and workings of Sedos. 

We are always looking for people to get involved with Sedos in a variety of capacities, whether it be on the Board of Trustees, the Management Committee, on a Production Team or in a more ad hoc capacity. This report also sets out details about how you can get in touch if you want to be involved at Board of Trustees level, or indeed just want to provide constructive feedback on Sedos and its workings.

Finally, I would like to remind all members that minutes of the meetings of both the Board of Trustees and the Management Committee can be found [here](https://www.sedos.co.uk/about/how-we-operate), Sedos’ current policies can be found [here](https://www.sedos.co.uk/policies) and if anyone has feedback about any part of Sedos or its operations it can be sent to [feedback@sedos.co.uk](mailto:feedback@sedos.co.uk).     

We hope you find this report useful and informative! 

All the best,

Daniel Saunders\
Chair of Sedos Board of Trustees
