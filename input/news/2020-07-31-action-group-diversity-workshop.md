As a part of our [Commitment to Change](https://sedos.co.uk/news/2020-06-17-black-lives-matter---taking-action), Sedos recently introduced an Action Group made up of interested members. This has quickly grown into a collective of representatives from a number of central London amateur theatre societies.

So far, we've hosted a virtual workshop to establish the mission statement for the group. Lots of work is going on behind the scenes and we look forward to updating you all soon. Thanks to everyone whoâ€™s been involved and if you want to get involved please email mailto:equality@sedos.co.uk
