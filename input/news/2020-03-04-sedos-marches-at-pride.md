What a day! Thirty-five Sedos members, led by the cast and crew of*Soho Cinders*, represented the society at Pride in London last Saturday (6 July), the first time Sedos has marched in the parade. It was a fantastic day, with a brilliant atmosphere, and we were proud to show our support for our LGBT+ members and the welcome our community offers them.
