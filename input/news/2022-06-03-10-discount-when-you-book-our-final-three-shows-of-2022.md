This will be a queer re-telling of *[A Midsummer Night’s Dream](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-a-midsummer-night-s-dream)* (14-24 September) – Shakespeare meets gig theatre; dance, lip-sync battles, classic text, all fused into one riotous night of theatrical comedy.

Based on Stephen King's bestselling novel and the acclaimed movie starring Sissy Spacek, *[Carrie](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-carrie-the-musical)* (25-29 October) has been reinvented for our time in a new production sure to shake the Bridewell to its very core...

[*Amadeus* ](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-amadeus)(23 November-3 December) is a fictionalized account of the relationship between two real life composers, Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Peter Shaffer’s acclaimed play takes us on a wild ride through the trials and tribulations of genius, jealousy and revenge.

All three shows play at the Bridewell Theatre and you can [pop to the box office now.](https://sedos.ticketsolve.com/shows?_ga=2.21734520.2123882302.1654251454-1305180245.1654251454)
