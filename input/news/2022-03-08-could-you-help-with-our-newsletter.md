*8 March 2022*

**We are looking for someone to take over creating the Sedos newsletter each week from April, for approximately six months.**

The stories for the newsletter are all sent in by the end of Wednesday each week and the newsletter is put together on Thursday, ready for checking and sending out on Friday.

The newsletter is built in Mailchimp and it takes around 30 minutes to do this each week.

No experience or special skills are necessary - we will train you to use Mailchimp and the newsletter will be checked by a member of the marketing group after you've created it every week before it goes out. There’s the opportunity to be creative and put your own stamp on the newsletter if you’d like to do so. 

Could you spare 30 minutes or so every Thursday to play an important part in helping Sedos to communicate with our members and community? If so we’d love to hear from you – please email [pippa@sedos.co.uk](mailto:pippa@sedos.co.uk)

### About the Sedos newsletter

The Sedos newsletter goes to around 3,600 people every Friday of the year, aside from a break over Christmas.

It is a vital channel for us to keep in touch with our members and wider community, from audience members to potential auditionees. 

The newsletter includes information about upcoming shows, auditions, other Sedos events such as workshops and socials, the annual show pitch process, call-outs for team members for productions and help at get-ins and much more.

We’ve had a regular Friday newsletter for some years, but the current newsletter format dates to November 2020. The newsletter was redesigned that autumn to give it a fresh new look which ties in with the website, which was relaunched in June of the same year.
