We're delighted to announce the 2019 Sedos season of four musicals, three plays and a brand new movement piece.

Thank you to everyone who joined us last night for the launch of the 2019 Sedos Season, which features eight shows: four musicals, three plays and a brand new movement piece, as well as an enticing mix of social events and workshops.

The main season runs from 22 January to 20 November 2019 and takes place at the Bridewell Theatre, where Sedos are resident. We are also delighted to be taking Sedos on tour to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, with our improvisation group Simprov.

We were thrilled by the excitement in the room as we revealed the season and were delighted that the mix of productions caused a palatable buzz.

An ambitious production of Brecht’s full length play, *Baal,* kicks off the 2019 Sedos Season in January, which is followed by an immersive production of the chamber musical *Next Thing You Know*, by Joshua Salzman and Ryan Cunningham, in April. Terence Rattigan’s *After the Dance* follows on April, before Sedos brings the classic Broadway musical *How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying*, by Frank Loesser, home to heart of London’s business district in May.

To co-incide with the LGBTQ+ celebrations for Pride in London in July, we are presenting British musical*Soho Cinders*, a modern adaptation of the Cinderella story. This is followed in September by the romantic comedy *Arms and the Man*, the company’s first production of a play by Bernard Shaw.

We are very proud to present a brand new devised movement piece, based on the novel by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, called *Dangerous Liaisons*, with choreography by Sedos members Kimberly Barker & Thomas Leonard. The 2019 season concludes with a production of the epic American musical *Ragtime* with a book by Terrence McNally, lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, and music by Stephen Flaherty.

Auditions for the first productions of the year will be taking place very soon, and we'll be announcing audition dates for the entire season shortly. Some of the shows are still looking for people to join their production teams, so do let us know if you'd like to get involved - email production@sedos.co.uk
