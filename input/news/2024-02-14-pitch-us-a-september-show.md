*16 February 2024*

**We are now inviting applications to fill our September slot as part of our 2024 season. Successful pitches will take place at the Bridewell Theatre in September, where we are the resident theatre company.**

We’d love to receive pitches from anyone who wants to apply, no matter their background. As a society, we are committed to being [as inclusive as possible](https://www.sedos.co.uk/about/diversity-and-inclusion) and therefore are looking for a truly diverse range of people to come forward to be involved both on stage and off.

We are again offering pitch advice sessions to help interested teams with their pitches – this is a chance to chat one on one with a member of the management committee about your pitch, and receive guidance on any elements you might like to consider before the deadline. Further information can be found in the pitch guidance.

Even if you are not attached to a specific pitch, now is also a great time to let us know that you would like to be involved with a creative team.

The application form and guidance notes can be found at the links below:

The closing date for submissions is 11pm on Monday 11 March.

We look forward to hearing from you!
