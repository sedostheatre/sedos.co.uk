**We're delighted that Sedos has won five NODA London district awards.**

Four of our 2018 shows have been recognised in the recent NODA London awards, with five winners. Huge congratulations to all our district winners:

Sybil Conway Award for Best Female in a Play: Helena Bumpus as Emily/Peter in *Earthquakes in London*

Ken Wirdnam Award for Best Male in a Musical: Luke James Leahy as Officer Lockstock in *Urinetown The Musical*

Charles Sumner Award for the Best Male in a Play: Paul Francis as Robert in *Earthquakes in London*

Harvey Kesselman Comedy Award: Penny Rodie as Annabel Glick in *Lucky Stiff*

Pat Redhead Award for Best Drama :*Earthquakes in London*

All district winners are eligible to be considered for the regional awards which will be presented on Sunday 9 June.

In addition our poster for *Pippin*, designed by Rebecca Pitt, is one of three posters shortlisted for the Dumayne Warne Trophy â€” the programme and poster awards are given for the whole region and there is a shortlist rather than district winners.
