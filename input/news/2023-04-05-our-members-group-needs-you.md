**Got a great idea for a night out? Hankering for a Sedos social? Missing your old cast mates and want to get back together to do something fun?**

We need you to make it happen! We're looking for people from across our membership to help us with putting together events for the coming year.

We'd love to hear from you if you'd like to help with putting on a social or an event to bring everyone together. We've also got our members week this year in September that we're hoping to see as many of you as possible at - we're assembling a team of producers, creatives and members to help us celebrate the community that makes Sedos tick.

If you're keen to get involved - drop us an e-mail at [membership@sedos.co.uk](email:membership@sedos.co.uk)
