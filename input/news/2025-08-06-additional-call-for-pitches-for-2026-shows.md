*7 August 2025*

**To give our members the best variety of shows for our 2026 season we are now accepting additional pitches for established plays suiting a one or two week slot, and large commercially successful musicals suitable for a two week slot.**

We have lots of resources and support available to anyone considering pitching a show:

* A [Pitch Guidance document](http://sedos.co.uk/pitch-guidance) with all the information you need to know about pitching a show for Sedos
* A [Pitch Library](http://sedos.co.uk/pitch-library) of past successful pitch application forms, to give you an idea of what weâ€™re looking for in the submissions
* Free personalised pitch advice sessions to help you put together a well-considered pitch proposal - email [pitches@sedos.co.uk](mailto:pitches@sedos.co.uk) before 17 August to arrange a session

Once you have read the Pitch Guidance document in its entirety, you can download the [Pitch Application form](https://www.sedos.co.uk/pitch-form) and fill it out. 

You should email [pitches@sedos.co.uk](mailto:pitches@sedos.co.uk) with your proposed title and dates before 10am on 13 August so that we can confirm rights are available on your behalf. Completed pitches should be emailed to [pitches@sedos.co.uk](mailto:pitches@sedos.co.uk) by 10am on 22 August.

Please note: we may ask you to come and share your vision with the Management Committee on Sunday 31 August, so please let us know if you are unavailable on this date. These meetings will be in person, however we are happy to meet you virtually if you are not able to attend in person.
