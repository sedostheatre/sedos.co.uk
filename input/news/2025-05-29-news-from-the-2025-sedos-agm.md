**Thank you to everyone who attended the Sedos Annual General Meeting last night in the Passmore Edwards room at the St Bride’s Institute. It was fantastic to meet people who were interested in the future of the society and to have the opportunity to reflect on all the great things that have been achieved in 2024/25 as well as looking forward to 2025/26 – we’ve an exciting year ahead!**

Highlights of the AGM included the introduction of the Financial Assistance Scheme, an increase in the number of shows performed (“everything from Sondheim to Shakespeare” and an all black production of *[The Color Purple](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2024-the-color-purple)*), with two productions staged in new venues in London and Suffolk, being recognised five times in the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) district awards for 2024, open captioning at two performances, a rejuvenated acting group, increased awareness of Simprov and a healthy 26% increase in Sedos membership.

There was also an update on our current finances; diversity reporting; and our search for a new permanent rehearsal and storage home.

Members had a chance to ask questions about areas such as budgets, pitching and the society’s diversity and inclusion strategy and it was fantastic to see people show a passionate interest in the future of Sedos.

The Trustees Annual report gives more information about the society’s activities in 2024/25 and can be [read here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TAs_s0oKBnmUeDpTJA8UOa4kjUD74Cm6/view?usp=drive_link). Adrian Hau's operational summary can be [read here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nvtmqn2WJtfgKlAld8jOPf94R4Z0bhqE/view?usp=sharing).

A special mention was given to Daniel Saunders who stepped down as Chair of the Board of Trustees in 2024. Dan steered Sedos through the loss of our rehearsal, build and storage space and reshaped the charity’s views to focus on achieving financial stability across our season of shows.

Many thanks to Jack Brown who also stepped down as a Trustee in 2024 and to Sorrel Brown, Ruth Granton, Thomas Riggs, Tess Robinson and Henry Whittaker, who stepped down from the Management Committee at the AGM or earlier this year - your contribution and hard work is very much appreciated! 

Karen Braganza is also stepping down from the Management Committee after four years, but we are delighted that she has decided to join the Board of Trustees and will continue using her experience to help support the ongoing success of Sedos.

We confirmed the appointment of Karen and Eleena Misra KC as Sedos Trustees and re-elected Nicholas Dore. 

Shylo Allen, Lauren Clarke and Conor Larkin were confirmed as new members of the Management Committee and Adam Coppard, Adrian Hau and Olly Levett were re-elected. 

We are delighted to announce the new line-up for the 2024/25 year ahead:

**Board of Trustees:**

Karen Braganza (elected)\
Nick Dore (re-appointed)\
Matt Gould \
Adrian Hau (chair of Management Committee, co-opted position)\
Pippa Kyle \
Eleena Misra KC (elected)\
Graham White

**Management Committee:**

Shylo Allen (elected)\
Paul Caira\
Lauren Clarke (elected)\
Adam Coppard (re-appointed)\
Sam Ferguson\
Tim Garrad\
Adrian Hau (re-appointed)\
George Langdown\
Conor Larkin (elected)\
Olly Levett (re-appointed)\
Emma Miller

Trustees and members of the Management Committee have staggered terms so everyone does not finish their term simultaneously, hence why some of those listed above are neither re-elected nor new - their terms did not expire at this AGM.

Sedos is run by enthusiastic volunteers and a huge thank you was given to everyone who keeps the society running - from box office and front of house support to backstage and workshop organisers, plus marketing and communications.
