**We are excited to share a unique opportunity to perform for three nights at the Edinburgh Fringe.**

[Banana Hut Gang](https://sedos.l3v5y.co.uk/regular-events/simprov) have secured a two-week slot in Forest Space at Greenside (6 Infirmary St, Edinburgh EH1 1LS) but will only be performing on nine of the 12 slots. That leaves three slots, Thursday 27-Saturday 29 August, up for grabs.

If you have a show you'd like to take to Edinburgh and are interested, please let committee know by midday on Friday 20 March 2020 by emailing your application to [secretary@sedos.co.uk](mailto:secretary@sedos.co.uk). There's a quick turnaround on this so that we can make sure the show is listed in the Edinburgh Fringe programme.

The Sedos season is already rather full so the show will need to be very self-sufficient and committee will take this into account so the more detail you can provide, the better.
