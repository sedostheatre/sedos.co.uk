We start the new year with some fantastic news. Not one, but two of our productions have been hailed as the best theatre of 2017!

Terry Eastham, from LondonTheatre1.com, picked our recent production of Priscilla Queen of the Desert as his top pick of 2017, while Musical Theatre Musings named summer musical Little Women their Best Amateur Production of the year. This is fantastic news and the perfect way to start 2018. Congratulations to all involved.
