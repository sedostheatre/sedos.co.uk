**Thank you to everyone who took the time to fill in our [Covid-19 pulse survey](https://sedos.co.uk/news/2020-07-11-take-our-pulse-survey).** 

We've been looking at the results and there's definitely a keenness among members to do something soon but travelling to central London is a key concern for a lot of people. We'll be following up with the people that offered to help organise activities and will continue to think about what we can do within the current government guidelines.

If you have any further thoughts or wanted to offer to organise an activity, please get in touch via mailto:committee@sedos.co.uk
