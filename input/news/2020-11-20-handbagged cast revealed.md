**We are excited to announce the cast for our online reading of *Handbagged* by Moira Buffini.**

Thanks to everyone who applied for this reading. Unfortunately we couldn't cast everyone, but we are excited to see this great cast take on this very entertaining play:

**Q** | Pamela Major\
**T** | Maria Waters\
**LIZ** | Naomi Bowman\
**MAGS** | Kathryn Felton\
**RON** | David Pearson\
**SHEA** | Rhydian Harris

Over the course of a decade, two of Britain’s most iconic women meet regularly. In private. Sharing their views on what it means to be British and navigating their opposing opinions, do their smiles tell a true story? What actually happened behind those closed doors?

The meetings between Queen Elizabeth II, and Margaret Thatcher became infamous in the ’80s. In this theatrical comedy, Moira Buffini imagines their relationship, and looks at what might have happened when two of the most powerful characters of our time came face-to-face.

We would love to have a large audience for this one, so please email [readings@sedos.co.uk](mailto:readings@sedos.co.uk) for the Zoom link if you would like to join us. The reading will take place at 7.30pm on Thursday 26 November.
