*3 May 2024*

**Two exciting plays have been added to Sedos’ 2024 season, both taking place at the Bridewell Theatre.**

*Autobahn*, by Neil LaBute,consists of seven vignettes that explore the dramas that can happen in the enclosed space of a car. Under the helm of Taylor Davidson, a new director for Sedos, *Autobahn* plays from 17-21 September. This will be the second time Sedos has produced Autobahn, revisiting a show [which we staged in 2013](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2013-autobahn). 

The week after, we welcome back past Sedos director Zoë Thomas-Webb, who will be at the reins for *\[BLANK]*, by Alice Birch.This play premiered at the Donmar Warehouse and offers the director and company the pick of 100 unnamed scenes to create a show that reveals love, joy and hope against the harsh backdrop of the UK criminal justice system. *\[BLANK]* plays from24-28 September.

More information on audition dates for both shows will follow in due course.
