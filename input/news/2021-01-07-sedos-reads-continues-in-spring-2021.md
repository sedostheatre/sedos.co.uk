*7 January 2021*

**Sedos Reads returns with new performances starting on Thursday 18 February at 7.30pm.** 

Following our successful autumn 2020 season of six plays, Sedos Reads – started by Matt Bentley (*Much Ado About Nothing*, *Radium Girls*, *Halloween Double Bill* and *Handbagged*) – is being continued by Peter Foster (*The Miller and his Men* and *A Christmas Carol*) with three new performances for spring 2021. 

We were delighted with a broad involvement from members and friends alike, and our audiences (both local and international) continued to grow across the six plays. Links to future performances will be available nearer to the dates.

Performances will be on Thursdays at 7.30pm, 18 February, 18 March and 15 April. Our first performance will be Sheridan’s still resonant and satirical comedy *The Critic*.
