**Congratulations to the cast of our abridged online production of Much Ado About Nothing. Our excellent team of 13 actors pulled off one of the bard's best comedies with only a brief rehearsal beforehand. There was plenty of opportunity to lean into the comedy with costumes, masks and facial hair, despite the lack of physical interaction.**

Audience feedback was very positive. If you would like to watch it yourself to see how it all came together, you can see everything except the first few lines at <https://drive.google.com/file/>

We look forward to seeing you there next week!
