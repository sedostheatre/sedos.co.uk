**We’re delighted to announce the 2020 Sedos season of three musicals, four plays, plus more for our members.**\
\
Thank you to everyone who joined us last night for the launch of the 2020 Sedos season, which features seven shows — three musicals and four plays — plus a members’ week and several workshop-style productions.\
\
The main season runs from 25 February-5 December and takes place at the Bridewell Theatre, where Sedos are resident. The season has a new look this year, with all the musicals running over one-week and two of the plays — which both feature music — taking place over two weeks.\
\
The members’ week takes place in early May and is also based at the Bridewell. It involves a weekend musical workshop, play in a day and performances by Simprov and its offshoot group, the Banana Hut Gang. There is also a workshop production in September.\
\
We are also delighted to be taking Sedos on tour to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival again, with the Banana Hut Gang building on this year’s successful tour.\
\
We were thrilled by the excitement in the room as we revealed the season and were delighted that the mix of productions caused a palatable buzz. Auditions for the first productions of the year will be taking place very soon so we look forward to bringing you more news on those.\
\
Some of the shows are still looking for people to join their production teams, so do let us know if you’d like to get involved — email production@sedos.co.uk
