**We have now completed the upload of our back catalogue of past shows to [this new website](https://sedos.co.uk/news/2020-06-02-sedos-launches-new-website).**

It has been a huge manual process to transfer all our previous shows from the old Sedos website to the new one and we're delighted this is now finished and people can look through our old productions on the new site. [Check out the back catalogue here.](https://sedos.co.uk/past-productions) 

Thank you to Pippa Kyle and Stephen Beeny for moving the shows across and to website designer Olly Levett for lots of tidying up of bits and bobs!

The vast scope of the transfer project dictated that we simply brought across the same cast and production team information for each show as was displayed on the old website. However, we're aware that many shows, particularly the older ones, do not have full production team information. We are happy to add teams to these where the information is available â€“ if you can help us build the archive, send a photo of the team list from a show programme (or the list in another format) to mailto:marketing@sedos.co.uk and we'll upload it.
