We're delighted that our 2018 production of *Earthquakes in London* won the NODA regional prize for best drama, the Pat Redhead Award, at the NODA London Theatre Festival earlier this month (June 2020).

Congratulations to all involved and thanks to Sedos trustee Simon Hill for attending and pricking up the prize.

The design work for *Pippin* was also given a highly commended accolade in the contest for the Dumayne Warne Trophy for Poster Design.
