**We are looking into running a Masked Sedos Singer competition in the New Year.**

The concept is that disguised singers send in pre-recorded videos, which are then turned into an online package for viewers, with audience interaction and judges who banter wittily on the quality of the singing and/or who might be behind the mask. This could run over several weeks with heats building to a final or simply be one programme, depending on the interest.

Would you want to take part as either a singer or a judge? Or could you be the programme's host?

To help us gauge whether there is enough interest for this to go ahead, please email Pippa on [pippa@sedos.co.uk](mailto:pippa@sedos.co.uk) by the end of Friday 4 December if you would like to be involved. You can express interest in being a singer, a judge or the host - or in more than one of these roles! 

Remember, if you want to sing in the contest you should keep this a secret so no one has a head start on knowing who might be behind the mask…
