*9﻿ June 2023*

**Thank you to everyone who attended the Sedos Annual General Meeting last night at Theatre Deli, Leadenhall Street. It was wonderful to see so many passionate people interested in the future of the society and to have the opportunity to reflect on all the great things that have been achieved in 2022/23. Highlights included winning five NODA district awards for 2023 (amongst them the double whammy of Best Drama and Best Musical for *[Amadeus](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-amadeus)* and [Carrie](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-carrie-the-musical)), the launch of the Sedos values and our continuing commitment to diversity and inclusion.**

During the AGM we heard about the on-going impact of losing our rehearsal and storage space and the financial pressures that has put on the society. However, there was some exciting news about potential new spaces, which hopefully will move forward in the next few months.

We also learned about the key development areas the Trustees have been focusing on: diversity and inclusion, financial stability, governance and values.

After 13 years on the Management Committee, the last five as chair of the Management Committee, we learnt that Matt Gould was stepping down from this role. However, he was welcomed as an elected Trustee, having previously been a co-opted Trustee, and we are delighted that his historical knowledge of the society will be put to future use.

Long-standing Trustees Alex Baker and Robert J Stanex, plus Management Committee member Stephen Beeny also stepped down. They have over 30 years of Sedos experience between them and their commitment and dedication to Sedos will be missed. Thank you. However, we know they will continue to be heavily involved in the society.

Stephen was also presented with a Sedos Golden Ticket in recognition of his work with the society and becomes the fourth person to be given the accolade.

Many thanks to Ella Benson-Roberts and Jessie Davidson who stepped down from the Board of Trustees and Kish Soni from the Management Committee at the AGM or earlier this year - your contribution and hard work is very much appreciated!

We re-elected Jack Brown and Graham White as Sedos Trustees and confirmed the appointment of Ruth Granton, Olivia Perrett and Sam Sugarman as new members of the Management Committee. 

Adrian Hau was also confirmed as the new chair of the Management Committee.

We are delighted to announce the new line-up for the 2023/24 year ahead:

### Board of Trustees:

Jack Brown (re-elected)\
Nick Dore\
Matt Gould (elected, previously co-opted)\
Adrian Hau (chair of Management Committee, co-opted position)\
Sara Rajeswaran\
Daniel Saunders (chair)\
Graham White (re-elected)

### **Management Committee:**

Karen Braganza (re-appointed)\
Paul Caira\
Adam Coppard (re-appointed)\

Olly Levett (re-appointed)\
Olivia Perrett (appointed)\
Mark Sidall\

Trustees and members of the Management Committee have staggered terms so everyone does not finish their term simultaneously, hence why some of those listed above are neither re-elected nor new - their terms did not expire at this AGM.

Sedos is run by enthusiastic volunteers and a huge thank you was given to everyone who keeps the society running - from box office and front of house support to backstage and workshop organisers, plus marketing and communications.
