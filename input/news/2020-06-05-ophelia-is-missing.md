**Ophelia and her royal rabble were due to land in the Bridewell Theatre today, Tuesday 3 March 2020, but she is unfortunately missing and the show is postponed!**

Ophelia is missing

A love sick Horatio is out roaming the streets looking for Ophelia in light of the show being cancelled next week. Stay tuned next week to see if he managed to find her and the rest of the cast!

Ophelia Thinks Harder will return at a later date.
