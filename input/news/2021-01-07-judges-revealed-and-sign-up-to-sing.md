We are also seeking more singers to take part in the competition and we have pulled together [a full set of guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15GAFDC6iCFanyEqX3Yyux9ZJ9_aeSIa70kzrFkruJnE/edit?usp=sharing) covering costumes, song choice, technical aspects and how the competition will work so performers know what’s involved, so do check these out. It should be great fun so do think about getting involved!

Please email Pippa on [pippa@sedos.co.uk](mailto:pippa@sedos.co.uk) if you would like to sing in the Masked Sedos Singer – the deadline for letting us know you would like to take part is the end of Monday 18 January. The deadline for sending your videos is the end of Sunday 31 January.

**Meet the judges…**

*Liz Flint*

Liz has worked as a West End voice and dialect coach for 10 years, so by now she would hope to be able to spot a star when she hears one. During her (ahem) 25 years with Sedos, Liz has appeared in quite a few shows with quite a few brilliant singers: stand-out shows have got to be playing the jaded Queenie in the multi-talented cast of *The Wild Party*, and as various Eurovision singers in the most-fun-ever-had-in-a-show *Eurosedos*, and more recently, in her pre-pandemic bumper-performance year, as Joan in *After the Dance* and Linda Porter in *A Swell Party* down at the glorious Minack.

So it’s hard to dispute that Liz knows a thing or two about musical prowess and stage presence, and that, paired with the fact that she uses the same brand of hair dye as Davina McCall, makes her a shoo-in for a place on the judging panel.

*Angus Jacobs*

Angus is super excited to be a judge on Sedos’ version of *The Masked Singer*. He’s been a member of Sedos since what seems like the year dot, when it was on the cusp of closure and he appeared in various cabarets and *Cabaret* itself (as a Kit Kat girl in bra and pants), which happily started the rejuvenation of the society.

Since then he’s sung, danced, (fallen flat on his face), roller skated blind folded, eaten multiple bananas (still can’t face them), climbed down the Bridewell balcony, played a dead body in a wheelchair on stage and directed, choreographed and designed various productions over the years. What other skills do you need to possess to be a judge?

As a judge, Angus intends to channel his inner Bruno Tonioli ... though it’s more likely to come out as Dame Craig Revel-Horwood dear! Fab-u-Lus darling ... let’s see how many times he can get that in?

*Sara Rajeswaran*

Sara wants to tell you a secret: she’s never actually watched *The Masked Singer* on ITV. But she thinks she understands the premise. Or hopes so. What better qualification to be a judge? (Just think of her as the Amanda Holden of our line up).

Sara is a Sedos Trustee and has performed with Sedos in *Gormenghast* (playing a wall), *Legally Blonde* (sat on a toilet), *Reefer Madness* (where she was eaten alive) and *Ragtime* (winning the award for most time spent on stage lying down).

Sara considered entering Sedos’ Masked Singer as a contestant but quite frankly, with two little girls, she already spends a lot of the day wearing dress-up costumes and singing Disney. She’s looking forward to watching others do it instead!

**Meet the host…**

*John Kyle*

When Sedos announced they were doing their own Masked Singer, John immediately bought shares in the company that makes the Pan-Pipe Moods albums. When he heard that they needed someone with the face and body of Joel Dommett, he had no choice but to make himself available.

John was the breakout star of Sedos' concert performance of Hairspray, but is normally traveling the world talking about ponies, so has been unavailable for many of the leading roles for which he would have been ideally suited, leading to them inevitably being given to James Franey.

When not living in a lockdown-induced fantasy state, John is a commentator on equestrian sport to Olympic level and a professional voiceover.
