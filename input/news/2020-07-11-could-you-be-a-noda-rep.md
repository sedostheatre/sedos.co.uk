**Our wonderful District 1 NODA reps, Carly and Simon, are stepping down from their roles. They have seen a vast number of Sedos shows and provide us with excellent feedback on our productions.**

NODA are therefore currently (July 2020) looking for new reps for our district. Here's a quick description from Andrew Rogers, our regional councillor:

"Briefly, there would be the need to set aside time to visit shows and to write reports (although district 1 is one of the smaller districts by number of societies) and, of course, hands on experience of amateur theatre is important. The role is fun and it is a great chance to give something back to amateur theatre in London."

He would be very happy to speak to anyone that is interested in the role so please feel free to contact him on mailto:andrew.rogers@noda.org.uk
