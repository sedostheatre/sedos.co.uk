This week we launch a new design for our newsletter, which lands in your inbox every Friday.

The fresh look ties in with our relaunched website and there will also be improved behind-the-scenes integration with our box office once we re-start ticketed shows. 

Thanks to Chris Warner and Stephen Beeny for designing the revamped newsletter, Pippa Kyle for assistance with the move to Mailchimp and our regular newsletter co-ordinator Aileen Ryan.

Do you have feedback on the newsletter? Let us know your thoughts by emailing mailto:marketing@sedos.co.uk
