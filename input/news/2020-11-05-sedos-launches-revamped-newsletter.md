This week we unveil a new design for our newsletter, which lands in your inbox every Friday.

The fresh look ties in with [our relaunched website](https://sedos.co.uk/news/2020-06-02-sedos-launches-new-website) and there will also be improved behind-the-scenes integration with our box office once we re-start ticketed shows. 

Thanks to Chris Warner and Stephen Beeny for designing the revamped newsletter, to Pippa Kyle for assistance with the move to Mailchimp and to our regular newsletter co-ordinator Aileen Ryan.

If you'd like to receive the newsletter and hear about all our auditions, events and more, [you can sign up here.](https://mailchi.mp/sedos.co.uk/newsletter-sign-up)
