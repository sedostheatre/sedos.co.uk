**On Tuesday 24 March 2020 we were deeply saddened to learn of the death of the celebrated playwright Terrence McNally of complications from coronavirus.**

Terrence McNally was the author of the play *Love! Valour! Compassion!* which Sedos will stage later this year. He also wrote the book for three musicals which Sedos has performed: *Ragtime* (2019), *A Man of No Importance* (2013) and *Kiss of the Spider Woman: the Musical* (2010).

During a career spanning nearly 60 years, McNally created a vast body of work, including some 40 plays, as well as the books for musicals and libretti for operas. He won four Tony Awards, plus he was presented with a lifetime achievement award at last year's Tony Awards.

McNally, 81, was a lung cancer survivor who suffered from an underlying lung condition.
