The class will take place in the “Weston” studio on level minus 2. 

The nearest tube is Southwark but the studio is also close to Waterloo and Blackfriars.

Classes will also be starting at the slightly later time of 7.30pm, until 9pm. Access to the changing rooms on level minus 1 is possible before class so please
be ready to go at 7.30pm.

As a reminder: classes are £7 for members and £8 for non-members. You can buy classes in bulk in advance for a cost saving. 

All abilities welcome!

We strongly encourage you to search “Sedance” on Facebook to join the group, to be kept up to date, including the occasional last minute change of plans.

We look forward to welcoming you to a class soon!
