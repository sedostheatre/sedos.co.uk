**We’ve thrilled to announce the cast for our autumn musical, *Dirty Rotten Scoundrels*, a sexy and irreverent musical farce which is the final production in the Sedos 2021 Season.** 

Based on the film of the same name, *Dirty Rotten Scoundrels* tells the story of two very different con men, the debonair Laurence Jameson and the vulgar Freddie Benson. The chalk and cheese con men know they can’t both work the same resort so they decide to make a bet. The first to make €50,000 from one of the many wealthy ladies of the French Riviera town of Beaumont Sur Mare, will get to stay, the loser has to leave town. All they have to decide is who is the mark and no mark is more loaded and less aware than the American Soap Queen herself, Christine Colegate. As they try their different approaches to get the dough they find that Christine isn’t as easy as they first thought and that this con is going to be harder, more painful but the most fun they’ve ever had.

Nominated for 11 Tony Awards in 2005 with original Broadway cast including John Lithgow, Norbert Leo Butz and Sherie Rene Scott. This show has it all from glitzy dance numbers to hilarious songs and stupid jokes.
