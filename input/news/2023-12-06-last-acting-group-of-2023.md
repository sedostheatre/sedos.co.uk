*8 December 2023*

**As the year draws to a close, we had our final Acting Group session of 2023 on Wednesday 6 December. The Acting Group has become a regularly attended, welcoming space for actors to hone their craft and to work on scripts in a safe environment.**

The Acting Group has been run for the last few years by long-standing Sedos members Helena Bumpus and Lloyd Smith, but they've unfortunately decided to step down at the end of this year. On behalf of all at Sedos we'd like to extend a huge thank you to both Helena and Lloyd for all their hard work.

Currently our plans are to put our monthly Acting Group on hold for 2024 until we have somebody to take over the reins. 

We're actively speaking to people who have worked with us before to organise the return of the group in 2024, but we're always keen to hear from experienced directors and acting aficionados - if you do have an interest in directing and managing this class please do get in touch with us at [acting@sedos.co.uk](mailto:acting@sedos.co.uk)
