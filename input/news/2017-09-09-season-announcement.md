We're delighted to announce the 2018 Sedos Season of 4 plays and 4 musicals.
Thank you to everyone who joined us for the launch of the 2018 Sedos Season, which features eight shows: four one-week plays, two two-week musicals and two one-week musicals. The season runs from 23 January to 1 December 2018 and takes place at the Bridewell Theatre, where Sedos are resident.
We were thrilled by the excitement in the room as we revealed the season and were delighted that the mix of productions caused a palatable buzz. Audition details for the first shows of the year will be released soon.
Some of the shows are still looking for people to join their production teams, so do let us know if you'd like to get involved. Email production@sedos.co.uk
