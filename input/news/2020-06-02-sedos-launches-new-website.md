**Today (Friday 5 June 2020), Sedos launches a new website – the first major overhaul of our online presence in 10 years.**

Sedos’ first website went live in December 2003, making the society one of the first amateur companies to go digital. The website was then given refreshes in 2007 and 2010.

The 2020 edition of the website is mobile and tablet compatible, the first time the Sedos website has boasted this functionality, which reflects the way many people now spend much of their time online. 

The new site has been planned for a couple of years, with a great deal of work behind the scenes considering what visitors want from a website, what it should look like and how it should be structured, as well as building and populating the site. We wanted to take into account the different needs and priorities of different stakeholders coming to the website, from our current members to those looking to buy a ticket and our potential members, future backstage crews and auditionees.

The site continues to be improved and added to, but we're excited that it is finally ready to reveal to the world.

If you have any feedback on the new website or find any broken links, please do email us at newwebsite@sedos.co.uk

Sedos will also be launching a new box office system when we open bookings for our next show, as and when Covid-19 allows that. 

Particular thanks go to Olly Levett for building the site and to Stephen Beeny for leading the project, as well as to Pippa Kyle and Adam Coppard for their assistance and everyone who was on the initial new website and box office working group.
