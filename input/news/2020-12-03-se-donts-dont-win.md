**We welcomed 15 teams all festively dressed to our Christmas Quiz this week, skilfully crafted and presented by Father Quizmas AKA James Franey, supported by Santa’s Little Helper AKA Dawn Harrison-Wallace.**

After much fun, facts and frivolity everyone applauded the talents of the Se Don'ts, who with an amazing score of 58 just stole the coveted prize from The Quarantinis…

However, in a shocking exclusive the following morning Se Don'ts' spokesperson Deborah Lean confessed to typing the wrong score in the chat box!

So our congratulations now go to The Quarantinis, whose equally impressive score of 56 now makes them the Sedos Christmas Quiz 2020 winners – and the undisputed lockdown champions as the same team won at the Post-AGM Quiz.

The new Christmas Quiz winners' board looks like this:

**1st** The Quarantinis\
**2nd** We’re Lockdown Luvvies Get Us Out Of Here\
**3rd** Support Bauble\
**4th** Se Don’ts

Other notable moments in the evening included Support Bauble and Tiers the Season to be Melancholy earning bonus points for the best team names, We’re LockDown Luvvies winning the best nativity with a live performance and real baby, and Percy and His Thai Follies earning bonus points on two occasions for best random Santa and the biggest bauble.

And while we would have all loved to have been upstairs in a pub in the centre of London, our lockdown virtual evening meant we had more cats, dogs and babies join a Sedos event than ever before!
