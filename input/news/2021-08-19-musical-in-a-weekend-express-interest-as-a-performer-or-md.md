*Thursday 19 August 2021*

**Are you missing your musical fix? Then why not join us for our next “Musical in a Weekend” – Esgee Production’s *Pirates of Penzance*. This updated version of a Gilbert and Sullivan classic puts a modern twist on a much-loved classic - it even
includes a megamix!**

Rehearsals will begin the evening of Friday 17 September and continue on 18 September with a tech run and performance on 19 September.

Auditions for lead roles will happen on the Friday evening and performances can be done with scripts in hands.

Auditions will not be necessary for anyone wishing to join the ensemble and everyone will get the opportunity to be a maiden, a police officer or a pirate.

Directed by Emma J Leaver, this show is a chance to have some silly, musical fun this September.

In addition to expressions of interest from performers we are looking for music director(s), répétiteur(s) as well as anyone willing to assist with helping out making and sourcing costume pieces and props.

To express your interest please email [weekendmusical@sedos.co.uk](mailto:weekendmusical@sedos.co.uk)
