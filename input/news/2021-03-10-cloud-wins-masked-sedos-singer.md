**Huge congratulations to Andrew Overin, who won the Masked Sedos Singer final last night. Andrew performed as Cloud.**

Six contestants – BananaDrama (Richard Upton), Cloud, Lady Poodle (Romana Moss), Horse (Michael Cannon), Owl (Susan Booth) and Triceratops (James Franey) – made it through to the final after the heats on 16 and 17 February.

After the audience had seen their new songs, they voted and the top two, Lady Poodle and Cloud, went through to a final showdown. The viewers and judges had a chance to see this pair’s heat performances again before the last vote, in which Cloud prevailed.

Andrew then joined host John Kyle and judges Liz Flint, Angus Jacobs and Sara Rajeswaran live on air to chat about recording his performances.

Thank you and congratulations to everyone who took part in the Masked Sedos Singer.

The team are looking at the possibility of a second season and would love to hear from potential singers and are also keen to canvass audience views.
