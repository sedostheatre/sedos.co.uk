*When The Rain Stops Falling* moves from the claustrophobia of a London flat in 1959 to the windswept coast of southern Australia, and into the heart of the Australian desert in 2039. It interweaves a series of connected stories as seven people confront the mysteries of their past in order to understand their future, revealing how patterns of secrets, love and abandonment are passed on.

The award winning play received its European premiere at the Almeida Theatre, London, in May 2009. 

**The production team are looking for a voice and accent coach to come in to do a rehearsal or two before the end of this year, to give some tips and advice to our cast as they develop their Australian accents. If you are interested, please email rain@sedos.co.uk to discuss this further.** 

*When The Rain Stops Falling* takes place at the Bridewell Theatre from 22-26 February and tickets are now on sale via the [Sedos box office.](https://sedos.ticketsolve.com/shows)
