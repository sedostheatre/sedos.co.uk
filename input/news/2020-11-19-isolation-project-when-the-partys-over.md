*19 November 2020*

**Our [Isolation video project](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2020-isolation) continues with two versions of *When the Party's Over,* by Michael Reffold. Having read the script a few times, Will Harrison-Wallace realised he had had some different ideas on how to deliver the script, so recorded two very different versions. Which do you prefer?**

 We asked Michael which version came closest to his vision of the monologue and he told us: "I loved both performances and actually I think my intention was to have the mood pitched somewhere between the two, but I was really pleased to see he’d picked up on the darker subtext I had threaded through (or tried to at least!)."

When asked to describe the monologue in more detail, Michael told us: "I’m mostly a poet, and my writing is often centred on a particular emotion or snapshot in time. With *When the Party’s Over*, I wanted to explore how we see someone who doesn’t know they’re being observed - for example, when they suddenly find themselves alone. I also tried to leave the monologue open to interpretation with an apparently light-hearted tone but hints of an underlying darkness. Hopefully that comes across in these two versions!"

Michael has been an audience member for a number of Sedos shows, but this is the first time he has actively been involved.
