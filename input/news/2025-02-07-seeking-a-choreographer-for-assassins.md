We are seeking a choreographer to join the creative team for ***[Assassins](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2025-assassins)***, by Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman. 

We will be setting the production at an American political convention with a dancing chorus (separate from the ensemble) to support the convention hosts - think Las Vegas, think big smiles, think cheerleaders and pompoms! This is a fantastic opportunity for a choreographer to bring the convention to life as well as helping with the overall musical staging. 

We will be auditioning in June with rehearsals (Tuesdays/Thursdays and Saturdays) starting in mid-July.

If you are a choreographer interested in joining the team, we'd love to hear from you! 

Please email [assassins@sedos.co.uk](mailto:assassins@sedos.co.uk)
