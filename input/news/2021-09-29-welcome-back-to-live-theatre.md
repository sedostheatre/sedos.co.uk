*29 September 2021*

**Our Chairs wrote the note below for the programme for *[Ophelia Thinks Harder](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2020-ophelia-thinks-harder)*, but we wanted to share it with the whole society as we welcome everyone back to the Bridewell this week.**

After the events of the last year or so, it is wonderful to welcome you back to live theatre! Like all arts organisations, Sedos was shut down overnight back in March 2020 when the show you are seeing tonight, *Ophelia Thinks Harder*, was only a week away from opening night. We are delighted that this is our first show back.

During lockdown we haven't been idle, though - Sedos hosted a variety of online events from play performances to our very own Masked Sedos Singer. Our improv troupe, the Banana Hut Gang, continued to entertain and amuse and our weekly dance class, Sedance, moved seamlessly online.

Since restrictions have been lifted, we have hosted two Members' Weeks, including piano socials, Simprov and Banana Hut Gang and two plays in a day, and it has been wonderful to see everyone get back together and enjoy in-person live entertainment - both as performers and as audience members. 

The management of the society has been very busy as well. In light of the Black Lives Matter movement, we have [overhauled our approach to diversity and inclusivity](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-a-new-commitment-to-diversity-and-inclusion) and joined forces with Geoids and Centre Stage to create London Drama Societies - a space to develop and share resources to promote diversity and inclusion. 

And we are also in the final stages of moving from our long-term rehearsal and production space. This has been a mammoth undertaking, and we extend much thanks to all of our members who have been leading the charge on that - from sourcing new spaces to decluttering our vast acquisition of costumes, set, props and techy kit - whilst also getting this season and the next back on the road!

For 2021 we will be staging not one but two musicals - *[Working](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2020-working-a-musical)* and *[Dirty Rotten Scoundrel](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-dirty-rotten-scoundrels)*s, as well as All Together Now, a collaboration with our friends at Centre Stage, Geoids and Bishopsgate Institute. And for 2022 - in addition to four shows postponed from 2020, we’ll be staging a few great additions - *[American Idiot](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-american-idiot)*, [Carrie: The Musical](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-carrie-the-musical) and the celebrated Royal Court play *[When The Rain Stops Falling](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-when-the-rain-stops-falling)*. 

With the exception of brief intermissions during the two World Wars, Sedos has produced quality live theatre in the City of London every year over its 116-year existence, even including 2020. However this has been the longest period, since 1947, in which we have been unable to stage a full production. So we are absolutely delighted, and just a little bit emotional, to finally be getting back to what we love - producing and performing quality in-person live theatre.

We hope that you enjoy not only the show but the experience of being back in a theatre once again.
