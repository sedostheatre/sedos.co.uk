**Plan your theatre trips for 2025 – and receive a special discount.**

We are delighted to offer our most loyal audience members a special discount when you book our [2025 shows](<>) at the [Bridewell Theatre](<>) . 

If you book any four (or more) shows in our 2025 Bridewell season in one transaction, you will receive 25% off. The discount will be applied automatically at the [online box office](<>). 

The discount allows you to indulge your musical desires by booking all four of Sedos’ 2025 London musicals – or perhaps you like to mix plays and musicals? Of course, by booking early you not only receive 25% off, you also have the best choice of seats so you can be sure of securing your favourite spot. 

Unfortunately there seems to be a gremlin in the box office system which means the multi-buy discount is not being automatically applied when combined with our standard Sedos membership ticket discount. To receive the discount, members should therefore make a booking for four (or more) shows online in a single transaction, then forward your confirmation email to [tickets@sedos.co.uk](<>) and we will organise you a refund of the relevant amount so that the discount is applied.

**[Visit the box office](<>)**

The shows which are on sale are:

[Violet](<>) (25-29 March)
[Hairspray](<>) (7-17 May)
[Hedda Gabler](<>) (8-12 May)
[The Crucible](<>) (16-20 September)
[Assassins](<>) (23-27 September)
[Dreamgirls](<>) (19-29 November)

We look forward to welcoming you to the Bridewell Theatre for our 2025 shows.
