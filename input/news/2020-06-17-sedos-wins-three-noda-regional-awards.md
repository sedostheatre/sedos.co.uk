**Sedos won three awards at the NODA London virtual regional awards on Sunday 14 June 2020, following our [eight wins at district level.](https://sedos.co.uk/news/2020-05-15-sedos-wins-eight-noda-district-awards)**

Huge congrats to all involved with the winning shows. The awards were:

**Joe Putnam Award for best musical:** *Ragtime*

**Ken Wirdnam Award for best male in a musical:** James Leggat as J P Finch in *How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying*

**Shinfield Players Scenic Award for design:** *Arms and the Man*

The citation from our district 1 reps for the Flame Award given for Ragtime was also published:

“We came out of the Bridewell emotionally exhausted but would happily have attended every night of the run. We are going to judge every future *Ragtime* that we go to see by the number of mascara-streaked faces in the bar during the interval. You created an absolute theatrical tour-de-force, which has raised the bar of what amateur theatre can achieve aspirationally high. This was a tight-knit and well-rounded cast. Everyone showed such great characterisation, each with their own very individual personality, and energy was tirelessly unflagging throughout. This production would not have looked out of place on a professional stage.”
