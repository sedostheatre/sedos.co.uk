**Can you believe 12 months have passed since we were down in Cornwall?**

It's a year since Sedos' debut production at the Minack Theatre, from 10-14 June 2019.

This incredible theatre carved out of the face of the cliff has been a must-visit destination for theatre fans for decades and we were privileged to be able to perform *A Swell Part*y, a celebration of the life and work of Cole Porter, in such a beautiful spot.

The cast, band and crew experienced weather ranging from sunburn-inducing heat to freezing wind and rain, but everyone enjoyed a wonderful week and we very much hope to return to the Minack in the future.
