**Please let us know if you have any suggestions for more virtual Sedos events.** 

Given that it looks like sadly Sedos will have to continue to operate in a virtual world for some time longer, please let us know if there are any events that you or a group of you are interested in organising - for example more virtual plays to build on the success of *The Lieutenant of Inishmore* and ***[The Importance of Being Earnest](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2020-the-importance-of-being-earnest)***! 

If you have any thoughts, please contact **[membership@sedos.co.uk](mailto:membership@sedos.co.uk)**.
