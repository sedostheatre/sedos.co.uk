 To mark what should have been our *Sister Act* dates, we remember last year's *Weekend Musical of Hairspray*.  

The next few days should have been exciting ones with our Weekend Musical of *Sister Act* taking place as our Members' Week kicked off. Sadly, the lockdown prevents that, but we very much hope to reschedule for later in the year.

Meanwhile, take a look back at these pictures of last year's W*eekend Musical of Hairspray*, which over 60 people took part in, with Ryan Macaulay at the helm as Musical Director.

Good morning Baltimore Every day's like an open door
Every night is a fantasy
Every sound's like a symphony...
