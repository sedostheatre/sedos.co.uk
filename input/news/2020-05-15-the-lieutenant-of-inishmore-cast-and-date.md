A huge thank you to everyone who sent in an audition video! They were uniformly great, and we could have cast the show several times over with the performances we got. 

The reading will take place over Zoom on Sunday 31 May, 7.30-9pm. If you're interested in watching, all you have to do is send a quick email saying you want to watch to events@sedos.co.uk.
