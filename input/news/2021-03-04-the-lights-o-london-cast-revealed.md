*4 March 2021*

**Sedos Reads is delighted to announce our cast for *The Lights o’ London* to be performed via zoom on Thursday 18 March at 7.30pm.**

*The Lights o’ London* is a wonderfully exciting mixture of melodrama, comedy and romance, the sort of thing we watch on tv or at the movies nowadays. It was written for the actor manager, Wilson Barrett by one of the leading writers of the day, George R. Sims, in 1881. This was indeed a time of novelty, spectacle, and a theatre public comprising a growing and demanding middle class clientele.

To be part of our audience, contact audience@sedos.co.uk to be certain of your ticket.
