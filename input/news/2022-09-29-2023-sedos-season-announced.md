*30 September 2023*

**Thank you to everyone who joined us last night for the launch of the 2023 Sedos season.**

We’re delighted to announce that the new season consists of three musicals, two plays and a week of fun activities for our members and friends.

The main season runs from 21 March to 2 December 2023 and takes place at the Bridewell Theatre, where Sedos are resident. The season features two one-week plays; a one-week musical revue; two two-week musicals; plus, a members and friends week, with more details to be announced.

We were thrilled by the excitement in the room as we revealed the season and were delighted that the mix of productions caused a palpable buzz. Audition dates for the first production of the year will be announced soon and we look forward to bringing you more news on those.

Some of the shows are still looking for people to join their production teams, so do let us know if you’d like to get involved — email [production@sedos.co.uk](mailto:production@sedos.co.uk)

As you'll no doubt be aware, Sedos set out its Commitment to Change in 2020 and it has been a key factor in the pitch process (with all directors being asked to consider the diversity requirements of their shows), the decisions we have made on which new titles to programme (which we believe can be cast with diversity in mind), and this will continue to be the case.

We are committed to diverse casting throughout our season, this will be made explicit in our audition notices, and we will be working with all the teams to ensure that we are reflecting the society we live in, both on and offstage.

If you’d like to discuss our Commitment to Change further, please email us at [equality@sedos.co.uk](mailto:equality@sedos.co.uk).

We look forward to seeing you all soon!
