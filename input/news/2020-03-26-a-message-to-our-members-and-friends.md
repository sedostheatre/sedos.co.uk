Dear Members and Friends,

In light of yesterday's announcements by the Government, with much sadness, we have taken the difficult but responsible decision to suspend our operations for the time being and postpone a number of upcoming events.

The following Sedos events and activities are therefore postponed:

*Ophelia Thinks Harder\
Working*\
Auditions for*Love! Valour! Compassion!*\
Improv Workshop\
Simprov

Sedance is also cancelled until further notice.

We will make a decision nearer the time whether our Members' Week events (Play In a Day; Simprov; *Sister Act*) can go ahead as planned depending on whether the guidance changes.

We will refund tickets already bought for postponed events and audition fees for *Love! Valour! Compassion!*

Please bear in mind that our finance team are volunteers and it may take up to 14 days to process refunds. If you wish to follow up regarding a refund, please contact us via tickets@sedos.co.uk\
\
It is our intention to reschedule the postponed events when we are able to do so. We will stay in touch via our newsletter, facebook and updates posted on our website. Like everyone else, we hope to be able to resume normal activities as soon as possible.

We encourage everyone to do everything they can to stay safe and to look out for themselves and each other during what is going to be a very challenging time for us all.

Love,

Sedos xx
