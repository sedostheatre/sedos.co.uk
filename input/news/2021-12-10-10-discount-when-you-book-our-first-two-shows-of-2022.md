*10 December 2021*

**With Sedos’ 2021 shows all over, our thoughts turn to next year – and what better way to get ahead than to book your tickets for our first shows now?**\
\
We are offering a 10% discount if you book a ticket to *When The Rain Stops Falling* (22-26 February) and a ticket to *The Mystery of Edwin Drood* (22-26 March) in the same transaction. Simply head to the online box office, select your seats and the discount will be applied automatically.\
\
*[When The Rain Stops Falling](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-when-the-rain-stops-falling)* is a beautiful and expansive drama about family, betrayal and forgiveness, spanning four generations and two continents, all throughout eighty years of torrential rain.\
\
*[The Mystery of Edwin Drood](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-the-mystery-of-edwin-drood?mc_cid=c24ce53dfd&mc_eid=UNIQID)* is a hilarious musical whodunit loosely based on Charles Dickens' unfinished novel – and you, the audience, have the power to decide the outcome.
