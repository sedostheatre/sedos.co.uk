*24 May 2023*

**This year, we've decided to team up with our friends at Centre Stage and Geoids to march together in the London Pride Parade on 1 July under the banner of [London Drama Societies](https://www.londondramasocieties.co.uk). London Drama Societies was established in 2020 as a way to unite three of Central London’s largest amateur theatre groups under the united cause of championing diversity.** 

London Pride is a fantastic opportunity to **maximise visibility**, to **show unity**, and to **promote equality** – something that Sedos wholly believes is the way forward to reflect and encourage diversity in our membership. As part of this commitment, all of the societies have agreed to make this a completely free event for our members so that everyone feels able to participate. That said, places in the parade are limited so if demand is high we plan to hold a blind ballot to keep things as fair as possible.

Sign ups are now live on our membership portal - [membership.sedos.co.uk](https://membership.sedos.co.uk/signup/109). If you have any questions please e-mail us at [pride@sedos.co.uk](mailto:pride@sedos.co.uk).
