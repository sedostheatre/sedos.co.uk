**We are now inviting applications for a one week play to be performed as part of the 2023 Sedos Season. This production will take place at the Bridewell Theatre where we are the resident theatre company.**

We’d love to receive pitches from anyone who wants to apply, no matter their background. As a society, we are committed to being as inclusive as possible and therefore are looking for a truly diverse range of people to come forward to be involved both on stage and off.

We are again offering pitch surgeries to help interested teams with their pitches – this is a chance to chat one on one with a member of the management committee about your pitch, and receive guidance on any elements you might like to consider before the deadline. Further information can be found in the [pitch guidance](http://sedos.co.uk/september-2023-pitch-guidance).

Even if you are not attached to a specific pitch, now is also a great time to let us know that you would like to be involved with the creative team.

The application form and guidance notes can be found at the links below:

**The closing date for submissions is 11pm on Friday 31 March.**

If you have any questions, contact [pitches@sedos.co.uk](mailto:pitches@sedos.co.uk)

We look forward to hearing from you!
