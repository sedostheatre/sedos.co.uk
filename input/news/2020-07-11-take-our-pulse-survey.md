**We're really keen to find out what members are thinking about the current situation and the activities that Sedos is currently offering, given the lockdown restrictions that are in place.**

To try and pull together views on this and the eventual return to normality, we've put together a very short survey which we'd really appreciate you filling in. It should only take a couple of minutes and we'll be looking at all the responses to see what we should do next.
