**Missed our live Zoom production of Wilde's trivial comedy for serious people? Then you're in luck as it's now available to watch again online.**

Pass the cucumber sandwiches and pour yourself a cup of tea. Our rehearsed reading of Oscar Wilde's trivial comedy for serious people, *The Importance of Being Earnest*, is available to watch again online.

Directed by Lloyd Smith with a cast of eight, this delicious farcical comedy, in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personae to escape burdensome social obligations, was watched by 100 people when it went out on Zoom on 17 April 2020.

Watch this space for screening details for our next virtual play *The Lieutenant of Inishmore*.
