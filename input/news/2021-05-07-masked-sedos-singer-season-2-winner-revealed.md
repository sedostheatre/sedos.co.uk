**Big congratulations to Joey Henshaw, who won [Season 2 of Masked Sedos Singer](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-masked-sedos-singer-season-2) performing as Wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube man.**

During last night's final, Joey performed again along with Sheep (Robert J Stanex), Neighlificent (Susan Wilcock), Dog (Rob Archibald) and Hairy Styles (Kim Barker). 

The original plan was to take two contestants through to the final head to head, but with a tie in voting, Dog, Sheep and Wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube man all went through to the showdown, where Joey grabbed the majority of the vote.

Regular judges Liz Flint, Angus Jacobs and Sara Rajeswaran welcomed guest judge Andrew Overin – [who won Season 1 as Cloud](https://sedos.co.uk/news/2021-03-10-cloud-wins-masked-sedos-singer) – for the final and after Joey was revealed, he joined the judges and host John Kyle live on air to explain how he made his video of *Into the Unknown* from *Frozen 2*, which even included drone footage. 

Thank you to all the contestants in both seasons of Masked Sedos Singer, our judges and host and all those behind the scenes who made it happen.
