We're delighted to announce that Sedos won two major awards at last Sunday's 2017 NODA London Awards at the Radlett Centre.

The District 1 Flame Award was given to our "excellent" production of *Candide*, with the judges noting that the show was " both entertaining and a challenge for the performers...and a fine example of the current and growing standard community theatre currently enjoys."

Immersive theatre production *Such Stuff as Dreams are Made On* won the Innovation Award and the judges acknowledged the production's "outstanding attention to detail whilst creating inspiring and imaginative settings within a challenging alternative venue pushing the boundaries of conventional theatre concepts."

Congratulations to everyone involved; we're very proud of you all.
