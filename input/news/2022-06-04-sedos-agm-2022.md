**Thank you to everyone who attended the 2022 Sedos AGM last night in the Passmore Edwards room at the St Bride Foundation.**

We were delighted to welcome Adrian Hau, Jacob Hajjar, Josh Yeardley, Paul Caira and Tess Robinson to the management committee and to confirm the re-election of Mark Siddall and Tim Garrad. 

Matt Gould, Adam Coppard, Henry Whittaker, Olly Levett, Kish Soni, Stephen Beeny, Karen Braganza all remain on the management committee.

We also welcome Graham White and Nick Dore as new trustees, while Alexander Baker, Dan Saunders and Jack Brown are re-elected. 

Matt Gould, Ella Benson Roberts, Jessie Davidson, Sara Rajeswaran and Robert J Stanex remain on the trustees.

Thanks go to the members of the management committee (Peter Foster, Kate Gledhill, Steve King and Lizzie Levett) and trustees (Dawn Harrison-Wallace and Michael Smith) who are standing down, for all their hard work. Dawn’s service is particularly notable as she has served xxx STEPHEN I FEEL LIKE WE NEED SOME DETAIL HERE ON HOW LONG DAWN HAS BEEN ON COMMITTEE/TRUSTEES ETC - DO YOU HAVE THAT INFO???
