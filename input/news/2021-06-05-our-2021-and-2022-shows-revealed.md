**We are absolutely delighted to be able to share our plans for the next year and a half with you. Not only are we thrilled to have rescheduled the shows from 2020, we are excited to announce three new titles and we also want your pitches for our remaining slots.**

We will be kicking off with a jam-packed *[Members’ Week](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-welcome-back-members-week)* at the Bridewell from 25-31 July. It will include performances from Banana Hut Gang, a workshop with the Acting Group as well as a Piano Night. Full details of the week can be found online.

*[Ophelia Thinks Harder](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2020-ophelia-thinks-harder)* will perform at the Bridewell from 28 September-2 October and *[Working](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2020-working-a-musical)* will take to the stage from 26-30 October. Both teams are looking to fill gaps in their casts and [will be holding auditions shortly](https://sedos.co.uk/get-involved). *Working* will now be directed by Jacob Hajjar with Laura Ellis as producer.

Our final show of 2021, performing 24 November-4 December, will be *[Dirty Rotten Scoundrels](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-dirty-rotten-scoundrels)*, directed by Zoë Thomas-Webb and choreographed by Jonathon Grant. They are looking for additional people, particularly a musical director to join their team. Audition dates will be announced shortly, see the [show page](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-dirty-rotten-scoundrels) for more details.

Tickets for all our 2021 shows are [all now on sale](https://sedos.ticketsolve.com/shows) and with our swanky new box office, we're introducing allocated seating so book now for the best seats!

We have then confirmed new dates for our remaining 2020 shows in 2022:

**22-26 March 2022:** *[The Mystery of Edwin Drood](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-the-mystery-of-edwin-drood)*\
**5-9 July 2022:** *[Love! Valour! Compassion!](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2021-love-valour-compassion)*\
**14-24 September 2022:** *[A Midsummer Night's Dream](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-a-midsummer-night-s-dream)* \
**23 November-3 December 2022:** *[Amadeus](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-amadeus)* (pending rights)

Lots of next year’s shows are looking for additional team members so if you're interested in getting involved please get in touch with the production teams via their show pages.

We are lucky to have secured the rights for two further musicals

*American Idiot* will be our May show (10-14 May 2022) and *[Carrie: The Musical](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2022-carrie-the-musical)* will be in our October slot (25-29 October 2022) directed by Chris Adams. There are various opportunities to get involved with Carrie, see the show page for more details.

And then we need you!

We do not currently have a team to put on *American Idiot* so if that show excites you and you'd like to take it on, [we'd love to hear your pitch.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bbhThOKhturIFEobrTp9vBK1r2TMBs0MuZErDPAcObo/edit)

We are also looking for a play to fill our February slot. We're looking for something to complement our 2022 season and start the year off in style.

If you'd like to pitch a play or to put on American Idiot, [all the information is in our pitch guidance document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bbhThOKhturIFEobrTp9vBK1r2TMBs0MuZErDPAcObo/edit) and you need to submit by midnight on Sunday 25 July.

We are unbelievably excited to be getting back to live theatre and hope that there will be something for everyone over the coming months.

As you'll no doubt be aware, Sedos set out its [Commitment to Change](https://sedos.co.uk/news/2020-06-17-black-lives-matter---taking-action) last summer and we wanted to reassure everyone that it has already been a key factor in the pitch process (with all directors being asked to consider the diversity requirements of their shows), the decisions we have made on which new titles to programme (which we believe can be cast with diversity in mind), and this will continue to be the case as we consider new pitches.

We are committed to diverse casting throughout our season, this will be made explicit in our audition notices, and we will be working with all the teams to ensure that we are reflecting the society we live in, both on and offstage. Our Commitment to Change will be a journey, but we have spent much of the past year working on how to address this important issue in our decisions and actions. If you’d like to discuss our Commitment to Change further, please email us at [equality@sedos.co.uk](mailto:equality@sedos.co.uk).

We look forward to seeing you all soon!

*Sedos management committee*
