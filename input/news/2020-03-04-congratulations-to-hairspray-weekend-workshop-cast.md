Our Weekend Workshop of *Hairspray* (15-17 March 2019) was a huge success, with 60 people taking part. Auditions for 10 named roles were held on Friday night, with rehearsals on Saturday and Sunday before a script-in-hand concert-style performance on Sunday in front of an audience of nearly 80 people. The cast mixed long-term Sedos members with lots of new faces, with the emphasis on having fun. Congratulations to all involved!
