*9 November 2022*

**We were deeply saddened and shocked to learn of the recent passing of a much-loved Sedos member, Paul Cozens.**  \
\
Paul joined Sedos in 2008 to be a part of our production of *[Rent](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2008-rent)*. A multi-talented musician, vocalist and actor, he quickly established a role for himself at the heart of the society on stage, in the pit and in the Bridewell Bar.\
\
His performances included Judge in *[Parade](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2009-parade)*, Carney in *[A Man of No Importance](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2013-a-man-of-no-importance)* and most recently as Governor in *[Candide](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2016-candide)*. Paul’s work as a musical director included *[The Wild Party](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2009-the-wild-party)*, as well as countless outstanding shows for our sister societies in the City of London. He helped devise and musical direct *[The Show Off](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2014-the-show-off)* and was assistant musical director and/or played in the band for numerous other shows.

Paul’s love of performing, dry sense of humour and overwhelmingly generous nature infected everything he did; many individual and whole-cast Sedos performances evolved in no small part thanks to the extraordinary trust and confidence he inspired. Paul was a joy to have in any cast or rehearsal room and the life of many a party. He will be sorely missed by his family and by his many, many friends among our Sedos members and alumni.
