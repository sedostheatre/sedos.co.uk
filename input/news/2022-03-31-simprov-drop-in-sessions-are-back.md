### [For current information on Simprov, please look at the Simprov page](https://www.sedos.co.uk/regular-events/simprov)

**Simprov is back in-person for the first time since before the first Covid-19 lockdown, with drop-in improvisation sessions back on the schedule.**

The team behind Simprov, our [London improvisation group](https://sedos.co.uk/regular-events/simprov), are returning with live sessions from 8 April 2022.

The drop-in improvisation sessions take place at 7pm at Theatre Deli, Studio 0 (2 Finsbury Avenue, London EC2M 2PF). There is no session on Good Friday.

Sedos members and non-members alike are welcome and the cost will be just £5 per person. 

Come join the fun and participate. We are a collaborative group, so feel free to bring some games for the group to try or just enjoy what other people bring.

Perfect for the complete beginner as well as the hardened improv veteran, these sessions explore the fundamental principles of improv such as making bold choices, character development and finding your ‘game’.

Improv is a great way to build confidence and develop performance skills in a very fun and safe environment.

We look forward to welcoming you back to Simprov!
