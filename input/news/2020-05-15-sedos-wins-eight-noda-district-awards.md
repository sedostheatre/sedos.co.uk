**The society was recognised with an incredible eight awards, including best play and best musical.**

We are honoured to have been rewarded with eight NODA Central London District Awards for our 2019 season. This is a feat extensively beyond anything Sedos has achieved before, being a testament to the breadth and depth of our capabilities.

As well as winning best play and best musical, we were also delighted to receive a special award for our created dance piece, *Dangerous Liaisons*. It was amazing to see not only individual performers recognised, but also the company as a whole with the scenic award and best chorus work.

As we congratulate all those involved onstage and offstage with the winning shows, this is a reminder of how we work together across an entire season to put on excellent, challenging and innovative theatre. And we all wait patiently to be able to get back to doing what we all love, which is putting on great productions and entertaining audiences!

The winners will now be up against winners from the other London regions at the Regional Awards later in the year.

Congratulations once again!

**BEST PLAY:** *Arms and the Man* \
**BEST MUSICAL:** *Ragtime*\
**FLAME AWARD** (awarded for inspirational contribution to the pursuit of excellence in theatre and enhancement of the overall theatrical experience): *Ragtime* \
**TROPHY OF ENCOURAGEMENT**: *Dangerous Liaisons* (awarded for its innovation, imagination and originality)\
**BEST ACTOR IN A MUSICAL:** James Leggat as J P Finch in *How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying* \
**BEST ACTRESS IN A MUSICAL:** Zo Pisera as Emma Goldman in *Ragtime* \
**CHORUS WORK AWARD:** *Ragtime*\
**SCENIC AWARD:** *Arms and the Man*
