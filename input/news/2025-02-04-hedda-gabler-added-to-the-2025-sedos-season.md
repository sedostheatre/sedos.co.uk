**We're delighted to announce that we will be performing *[Hedda Gabler](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2025-hedda-gabler)*, in a version by Patrick Marber, at the Bridewell Theatre from 8-12 July 2025. Jonny Harding-Cooper will direct the production.**

This pressure-cooker story is about the illusion of freedom, the battle for social superiority, and the unbearable burden of losing control.

Widely considered a cornerstone of modern theatre, *Hedda Gabler* is a canonised masterpiece of the 19th century, played across stages globally and storming Broadway more than 20 times. 

Hedda is stifled in a world of sterile perfection and suffocating expectations, but beneath the surface, she is a powder keg of desire and defiance. When an old flame resurfaces with everything she’s been denied - passion, purpose, power - Hedda spirals into a game of seduction and sabotage.

In this retelling, Ibsen's work has been channelled through the mind of Patrick Marber, giving the story an accessible lens for modern-day audiences. Gone are the ruffs, corsets and bluster. In this gladiatorial reimagining, we are left with nothing but seven actors on a stage - but not everyone will come out alive. 

*Hedda Gabler* in this version was first presented in the Lyttelton auditorium of the National Theatre, London, on 5 December 2016.

This is the second time Sedos has performed a play by Ibsen, following* [A Doll's House](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2018-dolls-house)* in January 2018. It is also the second play that Jonny has directed for Sedos, following *[The Effect](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2023-the-effect)* in 2023.
