**Sedos Reads is delighted to announce the cast for Shaw's comedy *Great Catherine*, to be performed via zoom on Thursday 15 April at 7.30pm. This is the final Sedos Reads performance of the season.**

Great Catherine uses one of Shaw's favourite plot devices, the love triangle. He had already employed it to great effect in *[Arms and the Man](https://sedos.co.uk/shows/2019-arms-and-the-man)* (performed by Sedos in 2019), with Bluntschli-Raina-Sergius, and again in *Pygmalion* with Higgins-Eliza-Freddie. In modern parlance mfm; 

Shaw had grown up with his parents in such a ménage à trois, and he himself spent his adult life in similar "arrangements".
