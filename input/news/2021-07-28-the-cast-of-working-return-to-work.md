*28 July 2021*

**After pausing in 2020, the cast of *Working* are finally getting back to rehearsals on Sunday, complete with two new cast members.**

Sabrina Edwards and Georgia Blessitt join Adrian Hau, Jack Brown, Kate Gledhill, Olga-Marie Pratt, Sam Sugarman and Sanchez Simpson, and the cast couldn’t be more thrilled to get back in the room to get this amazing show ready for October.

*Working* is a delightfully funny and thoroughly touching musical which explores what goes through the minds of everyday people - from construction workers and waitresses to firemen, secretaries and cleaning women. It showcases the individuals' occupations and also laments their lost hopes and dreams - taking the average worker's viewpoint and showing that he or she is anything but average.

*Working* will be performed at the Bridewell from 26-30 October 2021. Tickets on sale now via the **[Sedos box office](https://sedos.ticketsolve.com)**.
