**After Edinburgh Fringe 2020 got cancelled, this group of tenacious improvisers wanted to find a way to bring their improv show to the people and keep the nation smiling throughout the lockdown. So they did just that: Banana Hut Gang are making a whole load of lemonade with all the lemons we’ve been given, and damn is it tasty!**

In their 2019 sell-out Edinburgh Fringe show *Choose Your Own…Improv!* Banana Hut Gang created a dynamic new form of long form improv. In this show the audience call ALL the shots, not just at the beginning when they pick a genre, lead character and quest, but also throughout the 45 minute long improvised play when they help to decide what will happen to the main character throughout the story. Whether it’s a murder mystery, sci-fi or romcom, the Banana Hut Gang create a brand-new world and the audience make crucial decisions that drive the story forwards, derail it completely or force the performers to return to previous decisions and choose another path.

*Zoom Your Own... Improv!* retains all these elements and slickly transfers them online, with all seven of the cast performing from the safe isolation in their own homes. Help choose the path the story takes by watching on Zoom, or if you’re suffering with decision fatigue, watch the whole thing unravel on Facebook live. Busy on Wednesday evenings? Catch up on past shows on their Youtube channel.

Banana Hut Gang member Laura Capaldi commented: “When Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2020 was cancelled we were all so disappointed, but we picked ourselves up, brushed up on our Zoom knowledge and reformed our show as a virtual experience. We’re so excited to bring our show to new audiences that have never seen it before and might not have been able to venture out to an improv show in the past. We can’t wait to see what genres and quests the audience will throw our way in the new virtual version of our show!”
