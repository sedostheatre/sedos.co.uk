**At the forthcoming AGM on 24 June 2021, there will be a number of vacancies on the Sedos Board of Trustees and also on the Management Committee.**

The Board of Trustees' primary responsibility is to ensure the long-term financial health of the society together with ensuring compliance with laws, regulations and financial reporting obligations.

The Management Committee is responsible for the day-to-day running and management of the society, under the oversight of the Board of Trustees.\
\
**Trustee Elections**

Under the terms of the Society's constitution, a number of the current Trustees will be standing for re-election, and there are a small number of vacancies from Trustees stepping down before the end of their term. So if you would be interested in becoming a Trustee, please contact Alex Baker, Secretary of the Board of Trustees at [alexanderjbaker@gmail.com](mailto:alexanderjbaker@gmail.com) for more information.

Applications to become a Trustee need to be submitted by 4 June 2021 with a short written statement indicating your desire to stand along with a short written statement explaining why you are interested in becoming a Trustee of Sedos, and the skills and experience you would bring to the role.

We are particularly keen to ensure the Board reflects the diversity of our membership and our audiences. 

**Management Committee Elections**

Under the terms of reference of the Management Committee, half of the current members will be seeking re-election. We are always looking for additional people to get involved with the management of the society, so if you are interested in joining the management committee, please contact the Chair: Matt Gould, at [matt@sedos.co.uk](mailto:matt@sedos.co.uk). Applications to become a member of the Management Committee need to be submitted by 4 June 2021 with a short written statement indicating your desire to stand along with a short written statement explaining why you are interested in becoming a member of the Management Committee and the skills and experience you would bring to the role.\

In the event that more people are interested in becoming members of the Management Committee than there are places, then there may be the opportunity to vote. We are really keen that the management committee is as representative of our members as possible – so we’d particularly like to hear from members who are performers/directors. We’ll also be pushing our members activities as we get back going “in-person”, so are keen for people to get involved who would like to promote members’ activities and of course we would be delighted for members to get involved who want to help promote and drive our diversity initiatives.  \

Matt Gould is one of the Committee Members standing for re-election this year. Matt is seeking re-election as a committee member and as Chair of the Management Committee. If you are interested in being considered for the Chair of Management Committee role, please contact Dawn Harrison Wallace, Chair of Trustees, at [dawn@harrison-wallace.com](mailto:dawn@harrison-wallace.com).
