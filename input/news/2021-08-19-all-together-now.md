*20 August 2021*

***Frozen*, *Come From Away*, *Les Misérables* all in one evening… Does this sound like your cup of tea?**

We’re looking to join forces with our friends at Centre Stage, Geoids and Bishopsgate to put on *All Together Now!*, the unique new revue by MTI featuring many songs from their beloved shows.

This will be performed as part of a global celebration of musical theatre on 12-13 November and we are looking for a creative team, particularly a director and musical director.

More details about the revue can be found on the [MTI website](https://www.mtishows.co.uk/mtis-all-together-now).

If you would like to get involved in the creative team, please use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJ5isSoc358ohI5PQ4SGIeMWW79GXFf4RrRpwZqRsFo9irgw/viewform) to express your interest by the end of August.\
