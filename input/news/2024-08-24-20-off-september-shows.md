*24 August 2024*

**Thinking of seeing one of our autumn plays? Why not see both and take advantage of a great discount? We're offering 20% off when you book for both Autobahn and \[BLANK].**

Neil LaBute’s *[Autobahn](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2024-autobahn)* is up first from 17-21 September and consists of seven short plays that explore the dramas that can happen in the enclosed space of a car. [[BLANK](https://www.sedos.co.uk/shows/2024-blank)] follows, from 24-28 September – Alice Birch’s play offers the company the pick of 100 unnamed scenes to create a show that reveals love, joy and hope against the harsh backdrop of the UK criminal justice system.

The discount will be applied automatically when you book both shows in one transaction at the [online box office](https://sedos.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows). If you have already booked one of the plays, email [tickets@sedos.co.uk](mailto:tickets@sedos.co.uk) to book the other show with this discount.
