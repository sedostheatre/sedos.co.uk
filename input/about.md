With a membership of over 200, a programme of around 8 to 10 challenging fringe theatre productions every year and a reputation for West End quality in every production, Sedos are proud of their claim to be the premier amateur theatre group in London.

The acting and producing membership includes an eclectic mix from all over London but maintains strong links with the City via its members from investment banks, law firms, brokers, the Exchanges and many other financial and city based firms. We are an unincorporated association run by an executive committee and a registered charity (no. 1099443). We maintain a strong emphasis not only on member participation but also on excellence, as the reputation of the society grows within the community.

## A Potted History

The Society was founded in 1905 by a group of senior members of the Stock Exchange led by Charles Dickinson and Cyril Bathurst who formed the Dramatic and Operatic Society. Their principal aims were twofold:

- To take advantage of the great variety of stage talent they saw scattered around the house, and:
- To use what was no doubt an actual extension of the virtuoso talent employed by the members on the trading floor at the time to raise funds for charity.

With the exception of brief intermissions during the two World Wars, since then the Society has presented musical and dramatic productions of all kinds and in so doing raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for a variety of charities. At its height the Society mounted four large-scale productions each year at the Scala Theatre attended by members of the Royal family and employed a full-time general secretary.

## Professional In All But Name

Some of the better-known names who performed for the society in the early stage of their careers include [Dame Anna Neagle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Neagle) (who danced in the chorus as Marjorie Robertson), [Franklin Engelmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Engelmann) of post war BBC fame, [Patricia Roc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Roc), [Guy Middleton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Middleton) and [Rosalie Crutchley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalie_Crutchley).

More recently television luminaries such as [Nicholas Parsons](http://www.nicholasparsons.co.uk/) and [Faye Barker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faye_Barker) have made guest appearances. The Society has always aimed at the highest standards of production and is proud to rank itself among the top amateur societies in Great Britain.

In 2012 Sedos became resident at the Bridewell Theatre.
