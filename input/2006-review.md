## *Big Love*

By Charles Mee\
12th - 18th March 2006

*Big Love* was a modern retelling of Aeschylus' *Suppliant Women*, with all the moral richness of the original, but only half the calories. When Lydia and her 49 sisters decide to flee their arranged marriage to Nikos and his 49 brothers, they land on the shores of Italy, where Piero and his extended family welcome them with open arms - until the men arrive to claim contractual rights to the (mostly) unwilling brides. 

Director Mickey Killaney’s version of Charles Mee's (re)making of this classic work was a wily, raw combination of music, circus acrobatics, talk-show confrontations and confessions with the reverence of a Prom Season and the continuity of Monty Python's Flying Circus. This romantic tale reminded us that love is so much bigger than any wedding vow, family bond, or lustful urge. 

This was no everyday love story - this was Big Love.

## *Merrily We Roll Along* 

By Stephen Sondheim\
31st May - 10th June 2006 

After the huge success of Sondheim’s return to the Bridewell with *Company* in 2005, Roger Harwood returned with another Sondheim classic. Regarded as one of Sondheim's most eloquent and accessible scores, Merrily had been hugely successful around the world, despite initially lasting just two weeks on Broadway in 1981. Two decades on, after various revisions to the script and the score, it made a triumphant return to the Bridewell to sell out houses for two weeks.

>Mickey Killianey was a convincingly likeable and human Franklin Shepherd - oxymora, if ever two were more apparent! This was no mean feat and also overcame one of the difficulties of the piece: that we meet the main characters at their worst and so do not find it easy to empathise with them as, or until, they become nicer/younger in the second act… For me the hero(ine) of the piece is Mary. Mary is the glue that makes sense of the relationships and really breaks your heart with Not a Day Goes By, even though you think Beth (Bridget Cross) had already done that on the steps of the divorce court. And here Chloë Faine got my vote from the opening; here was a woman who had been on a journey and I wanted to witness it. Right on cue my heart was duly broken - again.
