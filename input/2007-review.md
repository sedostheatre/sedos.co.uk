review-of-year: "2007"

The season kicked off with Alan Ayckbournâ€™s hilarious Comic Potential. Directed by Chloe Faine, Panny Skrivanos played Adam, a young idealistic comedy writer, who falls in love with his lead actress, Jacie (Sarah Boyes), who in an unfortunate twist of fate, is a robot. Sporting a cast of hilarious characters, and staged as a cross between Pygmalion and Little Britain, Comic Potential was both a touching and funny start to our season.
