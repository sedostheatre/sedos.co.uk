review-of-year: "2005 - Our Centenary Year"
---

2005 was the Sedos centenary year and what a year to be proud of! We were delighted to have found a new home at the Bridewell Theatre, and for the first time in a number of years the Society embarked on an ambitious number of shows, a plan to re-engage City contacts and a marketing campaign to increase membership. With rave reviews, new and re-established links with a number of City institutions and a membership increase of 250%, the year was more successful than could ever have been hoped for!
