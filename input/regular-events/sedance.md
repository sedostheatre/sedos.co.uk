What better way to get in shape, improve your technique or simply enjoy the buzz of dancing? (And it's a great excuse for a cheeky pop to the local hostelry on a Monday evening to catch up with what's going on in Sedos!)

This London dance class is for everyone, so whether you're an experienced dancer, or you've never danced before, you're more than welcome.

The class consists of a 50-minute warm-up, including stretches and technical work, and around 50 minutes of learning a routine, with each routine repeated for three weeks. The warm-up is set so you will learn it and build on your technique, flexibility, strength and posture at your own pace. The routines vary in style from jazz, musical theatre through to lyrical. You can join the class at any time (we teach the routine from the beginning each week) and you do not need to sign up in advance.

Classes are led by Tom Leonard (choreographer for Sedos’ productions of *Dangerous Liaisons*, *Legally Blonde* and *Guys and Dolls*) with guest appearances from Kim Barker – and occasional other guest teachers.

Please wear something comfortable that allows you freedom of movement and shoes in which you can point your feet (or do it in socks). Please let the session leader know of any injuries before the class begins and work at your own pace.

Make sure you join the Facebook group to stay up-to-date! Just search “Sedance” on Facebook to find it. Feel free to email sedance@sedos.co.uk if you have any questions.
