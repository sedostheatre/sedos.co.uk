**Members, grab your leg warmers, Sedance is on every Monday and what better way to shape-up, brush-up and nail your audition technique? (And what better excuse for a cheeky pop to the local hostelry on a Monday evening to catch up with what's going on in Sedos?)**

Sedance runs every Monday from 7-9pm. Classes take place at RADA, most commonly in Studio 1 of RADA Studios, 16 Chenies Street. Nearest tube is Goodge Street. Please email sedance@sedos.co.uk for more information and search 'Sedance' on Facebook to join our Facebook group to be kept up to date with the latest news.

The class consists of 45mins warm-up, stretch and technical work and 45 mins of learning a routine, with each routine repeated for 2-3 classes so everyone from our 'pro-standard' prima's to our 'mixed ability' movers can master the routine and improve their style and pick-up speeds.

The class is for everyone, so whether you're a bit of a pro, or you've never danced before, you're more than welcome, and can do as much or as little as you like. The warm up and excercises are repeated week to week, so you can learn them and work intensively on your technique, flexibility and posture at your own pace.

Classes are led by professional dancer Tom Leonard (dance captain on West Side Story) with guest appearances from Kim Barker (West Side Story director and choreographer) - with occasional special guest teachers to be announced. The atmosphere is relaxed and supportive, and all dances are performed in groups.

Each class is for paid up members only and costs £7 (bargain!) on the door. Non members may attend a taster session (also £8) after which they need to join at least as 'friends' if they want to continue attending.Take a look at the new pricing structure below.

Please wear something comfortable that allows you freedom of movement (i.e. something stretchy, and no jeans). For the warm-up, if possible please wear shoes in which you can point your feet (or do it in socks!). Please let the session leader know of any physical impairments before the class begins and work at your own pace.

Look forward to seeing you there!
