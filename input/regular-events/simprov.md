**Looking for a London improvisation group? Simprov is the Sedos group that lets members and non-members explore their spontaneous side!**

## **The Simprov drop-in**

Our open-to-all session! Join us every Friday night (7-9.30pm) for an evening of games, learning and a whole heap of fun.

Perfect for the complete beginner as well as the hardened improv veteran, sessions with our London improvisation group will explore the fundamental principles of improv such as making bold choices, character development and finding your ‘game’.

Improv is a great way to build confidence and develop performance skills in a very fun and safe environment.

Come join the fun and participate. We are a collaborative group, so feel free to bring some games for the group to try or just enjoy what other people bring.

Simprov takes place at Theatre Deli, Studio 8, 107 Leadenhall Street, EC3A 4AF. The cost is £7 per person (£5 for Sedos members) to pay for the room rental. See you there!

After four years we have decided to bring our support of in-house improv group The Banana Hut Gang, which was formed from a collection of the most die-hard Simprov attendees, to an end. This will allow the group to go their own way and flourish outside of our organisation. You can still follow the group on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bananahutgang/).
