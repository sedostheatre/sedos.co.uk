**Looking for a London improvisation group? Simprov is the Sedos group that lets members and non-members explore their spontaneous side!**

If you want to learn improvisation skills and practise them in a fun and supportive way, then the Simprov Drop In is the place for you. We also run regular workshops and courses that lead to public performances.

## **The Simprov drop-in**

Our open-to-all session! Join us every Friday night for an evening of games, learning and a whole heap of fun.

Perfect for the complete beginner as well as the hardened improv veteran, sessions with our London improvisation group will explore the fundamental principles of improv such as making bold choices, character development and finding your ‘game’.

Improv is a great way to build confidence and develop performance skills in a very fun and safe environment.

The Simprov team are returning with live sessions from 8 April 2022, at 7pm on Fridays at Theatre Deli (107 Leadenhall Street, EC3A 4AF). The cost will be £5 per person (members or non-members alike). There is no session on Good Friday.

Come join the fun and participate. We are a collaborative group, so feel free to bring some games for the group to try or just enjoy what other people bring.

After four years we have decided to bring our support of in-house improv group The Banana Hut Gang, which was formed from a collection of the most die-hard Simprov attendees, to an end. This will allow the group to go their own way and flourish outside of our organisation. You can still follow the group on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bananahutgang/).”
