**Simprov is the Sedos group that lets members and non-members explore their spontaneous side!**

If you want to learn improvisation skills and practise them in a fun and supportive way, then the Simprov Drop In is the place for you. We also run regular workshops and courses that lead to public performances.

We also have our very own in-house improv group, The Banana Hut Gang, which was formed from a collection of the most die-hard Simprov attendees. The Gang design new shows and spread the improv love across London.

## **The Simprov Drop in**

Our open-to-all session! Join us every Friday night for an evening of games, learning and a whole heap of fun.

Perfect for the complete beginner as well as the hardened improv veteran, sessions will explore the fundamental principles of improv such as making bold choices, character development and finding your ‘game’.

Improv is a great way to build confidence and develop performance skills in a very fun and safe environment.

**When:** Fridays\
**Time:** 7pm\
**Level:** All!\
**Cost:** £3 (free for Sedos members)
