**Simprov is the Sedos group that lets members and non-members explore their spontaneous side!**

During lockdown, Simprov will take place online via Zoom and will now take place every Monday at 7.30pm.

If you want to learn improvisation skills and practise them in a fun and supportive way, then the Simprov Drop In is the place for you. They'll be playing Zoom-friendly improv games for guaranteed laighs and a creative, confidence-boosting start to the week.

We also run regular workshops and courses that lead to public performances.

The meeting ID for the Zoom show is: 867 2997 183
