#### **U﻿PDATE - ACTING GROUP IS BACK!**

Our fun and friendly Acting Group will return on **Thursday 23 of May from 7-9pm at Theatre Deli**. 

Join Jamila Jennings-Grant, Josh Yard and Sarah Berryman for an evening of acting games, script work and guaranteed laughs! All levels of experience are very welcome and no preparation is needed. We'll then finish the evening with an (optional) trip to a local pub.

The session is £5 for Sedos Members and £7 for non-members. Please email [acting@sedos.co.uk](mailto:acting@sedos.co.uk) to register your interest or with any questions.

**\-﻿-------------------------------------------------------**

**After three brilliant years, our final acting group with Helena and Lloyd is taking place on Wednesday 6 December. We're hoping that someone else will be taking over the running of the Acting Group in the new year, so watch this space for further announcements. Huge thanks to Helena and Lloyd for creating and running this group so successfully.**

We're actively speaking to people who have worked with us before to organise the return of the group in 2024, but we're always keen to hear from experienced directors and acting aficionados - **if you do have an interest in directing and managing this class please do get in touch with us at [acting@sedos.co.uk](mailto:acting@sedos.co.uk)**

Sessions take place at Theatre Deli Leadenhall Studios, 107 Leadenhall Street, London EC3A 4AF from 7-9pm.

Sedos’ Acting Group is a friendly, relaxed and supportive atmosphere for people who want to act... whether you want to brush up on your skills, prepare for an audition or simply 'have a go', you are welcome! We tackle everything from contemporary to classical, comedy to drama, and everything in-between. We encourage all levels of ability to take part, it doesn’t matter whether it’s your first time acting or your 50th time! 

There’s nothing to prepare. Bring yourself, a tea or coffee, take a script to rehearse for an hour, and then we’ll perform the scenes to the group at the end. And of course there’s the non-obligatory trip to the pub afterwards. 

You can also bring your own script if you have a specific audition piece you want to try, or if you just really like the script! But please be aware we can’t guarantee all scripts will be used. 

Scripts should be approximately five minutes (no longer than eight minutes) and there will be a selection of 2-3 handers on the day to choose from (monologues are welcome too).

There is a £5 payment for Sedos members and non-members alike at our London Acting Group.

Please sign up by emailing Helena and Lloyd at [](mailto:[acting@sedos.co.uk](<>))[acting@sedos.co.uk](mailto:acting@sedos.co.uk) for each individual session, stating your name and any questions – only participants who have emailed will receive the bespoke booking link for the specific date.

That's it! We will reply confirming the studio number at Theatre Deli a few days ahead of the group.
