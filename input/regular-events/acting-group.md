**Our friendly Acting Group is back for more once a month Thursday fun at Theatre Deli.**

Join Jamila Jennings-Grant, Josh Yard and Sarah Berryman for an evening of acting games, script work and guaranteed laughs! All levels of experience are very welcome and no preparation is needed. We'll then finish the evening with an (optional) trip to a local pub.

Sessions take place 7-10pm at [Theatre Deli](https://www.sedos.co.uk/venues/theatre-deli), 107 Leadenhall Street, London EC3A 4AF

The session is £5 for Sedos members and £7 for non-members. 

Please [book here](https://sedos.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/1173655734) or email [acting@sedos.co.uk](mailto:acting@sedos.co.uk) with any questions.
