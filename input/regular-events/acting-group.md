#### **DUE TO CORONAVIRUS, THE ACTING GROUP HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED**

The Acting Group offers sessions approximately once a month, with a friendly, relaxed and supportive atmosphere for people who want to act... whether you want to brush up on their skills, prepare for an audition or simply "have a go". 

All levels of ability are welcome, whether it's your first time or your 50th time! 

There's nothing to prepare. Bring yourself, a tea or coffee, and take a script to rehearse for a few hours then we'll perform the scenes to the group at the end. 

You can also bring your own script if you have a specific audition piece you want to try, or if you just really like the script! Scripts should be approx. 5 minutes (no longer than 8 minutes) and there will also be a selection of two-three handers on the day to choose from (monologues are welcome too).

It's free to take part in the Acting Group â€” just email [events@sedos.co.uk ](mailto:events@sedos.co.uk)to give us an idea of numbers. We won't reply back, unless you have a specific question.
