**We're delighted to announce that Sechoir is returning in 2018 under the baton of Michael Cannon, who was the Musical Director of _The Drowsy Chaperone_ (2017) and _I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change_ (2016). We're very excited to be working with Michael once again on re-launching this much requested members event.**

Each Sechoir term will last for 12 weeks, with a break in the middle, and will culminate in a concert in the Bridewell Theatre on the Sunday in-between the two two-week musicals. This will become a showcase for the talents of our members and the many activities we provide.

Classes will run on *Wednesdays at BHG*, between *7-9pm*, starting on *Wednesday 14 February 2018*. The term dates for 2018 are listed below.

There is a "drop in" rate of £4 for members and £6 for non members to attend Sechoir. If you'd like to pay for the whole term upfront, then there is a special term rate of £36 for members and £54 non members, saving £12 and £18 respectively.

We look forward to seeing you - and hearing you!
