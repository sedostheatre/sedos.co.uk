Sedos is a Charitable Incorporated Organisation.

**[Click here to read the constitution](/assets/SedosConstitution.pdf)**.

Sedos' charitable objects are:

(i) To educate the public in the fields of dramatic and musical theatre and to further the development of public appreciation of and taste in said fields; and\
(ii) To give an opportunity for persons interested in the fields of dramatic and musical theatre to participate whether on or off-stage in theatrical productions of high quality.

## Trustees

The trustees are ultimately responsible for the long-term financial health of the society and ensuring that the charity complies with its legal responsibilities and acts in accordance with the constitution. They keep an eye on the management committee and provide guidance as to the day-to-day operations of the society. 

The trustees' particular focus is ensuring that our financial reserves are prudently managed; we have long-term performance, rehearsal and build space and that the society is acting at all times in the best interests of our members. 

The trustees are elected by the members for three-year terms or co-opted in accordance with the society’s constitution. The trustees meet every three months.

**Secretary** | Alex Baker\
**ex officio, Chair of the management committee** | Matt Gould\
Ella Benson-Roberts\

The positions of Chair and Trustee with financial responsibility will be appointed at the first Trustees meeting.
