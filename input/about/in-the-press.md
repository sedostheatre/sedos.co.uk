## Sedos in the press

**2018** 

*Urinetown* 

“As is the custom with Sedos productions the cast, whether in a small or large part, are all first rate and work so well together whether singing, dancing – choreography by Kim Barker – or moving Andrew Laidlaw’s wonderfully versatile set around. Given the commitment of everyone involved, it must be great being a director at Sedos and Yojiro Ichikawa has got a fantastic cast, great set and excellent lighting by Olly Levett all working together seamlessly to bring *Urinetown: The Musical* to life… Get a ticket, take a seat and sit back for the happiest couple of hours you are likely to have this side of the festive period.” [Urinetown, 2018, London Theatre 1 (\*\*\*\**)](https://www.londontheatre1.com/reviews/urinetown-the-musical-at-the-bridewell-theatre/)

“Sedos’ new production of Urinetown is yet another example of why they should be considered one of the best amateur companies in London, if not the country… I feel as though this review is slightly too glowing but honestly, it’s a struggle to find fault. For a show that charges under £20 per ticket, this is a superb night out with plenty of bang for your buck.” [Urinetown, 2018, The 730 Review (\*\*\*\**)](https://www.the730review.co.uk/2018/11/22/urinetown-sedos/)

“Sedos have created a fantastic production, very cleverly staged in the round and with minimal set which allows for a very fluid production that keeps incredible pace throughout. The direction by Yojiro Ichikawa was fantastic, getting the most out of his cast and theatre, using every possible entrance to make sure the audience is pulled into the show… The Musical Direction by Ryan Macaulay was equally as impressive, with a great sound being produced by the band alongside flawless harmonies from the cast. The powerhouse of voices created a purely superb resonance with apparent ease; a delight to the ears of the audience.” [Urinetown, 2018, London Theatre Reviews (\*\*\*\*)](http://www.londontheatrereviews.co.uk/post.cfm?p=668)

*Dogfight*

“Dogfight is a charming yet gritty show about many shades of the human experience, from jubilant banter with friends, to romantic rejection, to the harsh reality of war.” [Dogfight, 2018, London Theatre1](https://www.londontheatre1.com/reviews/review-of-dogfight-the-musical-at-the-bridewell-theatre/)

“Sedos are to be commended for giving us the chance to see such a good production of Dogfight The Musical. Catch it if you can!” [Dogfight, 2018, Sardines](http://www.sardinesmagazine.co.uk/reviews/review.php?REVIEW-Sedos-Dogfight%20The%20Musical&reviewsID=3126)

*Pippin*

“It’s 45 years since I saw *Pippin* in the West End, and while the themes are certainly still current, the style and the devices can feel a little dated. Chris Adams’ compelling production, especially at the end, cuts through the tricks and the whimsy to achieve a genuinely moving piece of drama.” [Pippin, 2018, Remote Goat](https://www.remotegoat.com/uk/review/13861/deliciously-dark-stephen-schwartz-revival/)

“If ever a show was crying out for a large scale return to the West End, then Pippin is the one and, my advice is to all the members of Sedos, give up the day jobs and take it there.” [Pippin, 2018, London Theatre 1 (\*\*\*\**)](https://www.londontheatre1.com/reviews/review-pippin-returns-the-bridewell-theatre-london/)

“For my money the show is good enough to transfer West, half a mile up the road. Certainly, many of the cast could have a second string to their bows in the commercial theatre any time they wanted.” [Pippin, 2018, Sardines (\*\*\*\**)](http://www.sardinesmagazine.co.uk/reviews/review.php?REVIEW-Sedos-Pippin-&reviewsID=3204)

“Pippin is a triumph… highly recommended.” [Pippin, 2018, The 730 Review (\*\*\*\*)](https://www.the730review.co.uk/2018/05/11/pippin-sedos-review/)

“It was not good. It was very good... Go to the Bridewell and give some support to these guys. They deserve it!” [Pippin, 2018, London Theatre Reviews (\*\*\*\*)](http://www.londontheatrereviews.co.uk/post.cfm?p=303)

“The whole production is more polished and entertaining than many professional shows… In the hands of Sedos, Pippin is a gem of a musical.” [Pippin, 2018, Fairy Powered Productions (\*\*\*\*) ](http://fairypoweredproductions.com/pippin-review/)

*You Can’t Take it With You*

“I’ve seen a couple of productions from Sedos now and each one of them has really impressed me with the quality of the performances and attention to detail in the staging, and with You Can’t Take it With You, they have delivered another first-rate production.” [You Can’t Take it With You, 2018, lastminutetheatretickets.com](https://www.lastminutetheatretickets.com/londonwestend/review-you-cant-take-it-with-you-bridewell-theatre/)

“Sedos has never been, and never will be, just another ‘amateur’ company! Their work stands out dramatically in so many ways. They achieve the highest possible standards on stage whilst nurturing the skills of their very talented team of players, directors, set and costume designers.” [You Can’t Take it With You, 2018, Infobarrel](http://www.infobarrel.com/You_Cant_Take_it_With\_You\_-_A_Sedos_Production)

“Another outstanding performance! As in all comedies timing and teamwork are the vital ingredients and Sedos are experts at timing. They successfully maintain their American accents throughout and their attention to detail, particularly to costumes and set design, is excellent.” [You Can’t Take it With You, 2018, Infobarrel](http://www.infobarrel.com/You_Cant_Take_it_With\_You\_-_A_Sedos_Production)

“What a pleasurable and delightful play this is. I could go on at length about certain aspects in this production of You Can’t Take It With You that don’t make a lot of sense, but rather like The Addams Family, the eccentricities are what make the characters in this bizarre and chaotic – but nonetheless hilarious- so compelling and unique.” [You Can’t Take it With You, 2018, Londontheatre1](https://www.londontheatre1.com/reviews/review-you-cant-take-it-with-you-bridewell-theatre/)

*Earthquakes in London*

“It is unfortunate that for too many people, the epithet “amateur” in relation to theatre remains redolent of inexpert performance in draughty church halls by well-meaning performers of limited talent. The reality is that for many groups nowadays, there is an almost invisible line between so called professional performance (ironically not necessarily of the highest quality) and other productions which are only amateur in the sense that participants have not been paid. Sedos specifically states in its programme notes that they “strive for professional standards in both performance and production values” and it is fair to say that they have a well-established reputation in achieving that ambition which has once again been reinforced by this production of Earthquakes in London.” [Earthquakes in London, 2018, Musical Theatre Musings](http://musicaltheatremusings.co.uk/earthquakes-in-london)

“All told, this is another great production from Sedos that makes you stop and think about what we are doing to the earth and if we shouldn’t be trying something different so that by the year 2525, man will still be alive.” [Earthquakes in London, 2018, Londontheatre1](https://www.londontheatre1.com/reviews/earthquakes-in-london-at-the-bridewell-theatre-review/)

“The absolute bravery, or maybe insanity, of director Chris Davis to stage this play in an amateur production makes it all the more incredible. And that mention of amateur is the only time it should be raised, because believe me, there is absolutely nothing amateur about this production.” [Earthquakes in London, 2018, Everything Theatre](http://everything-theatre.co.uk/2018/07/earthquakes-in-london-bridewell-theatre-review.html)

*Lucky Stiff*

“Huge congratulations must go to the whole production team for putting on a fabulous show. This show is a MUST to see and would recommend to anyone.” [Lucky Stiff, 2018, Musical Theatre Musings](http://musicaltheatremusings.co.uk/lucky-stiff)

“This show was directed with “big show values” – it had colour, glamour, a powerful orchestra, very clever set design and beautifully contrasting performances.” [Lucky Stiff, 2018, Sardines (\*\*\*\*)](http://www.sardinesmagazine.co.uk/reviews/review.php?REVIEW-Sedos-Lucky%20Stiff%20-%20★★★★&reviewsID=3327)

*Our Country’s Good*

"Strong production of modern classic." [Our Country’s Good, 2018, Remote Goat](https://www.remotegoat.com/uk/review/14089/strong-production-of-modern-classic/)

“I think this production of Our Country’s Good is the best non-professional 'straight' play (musicals are a different animal) I have ever seen. Of course that’s partly down to the strength of Wertenbaker’s timeless, topical, funny, poignant, horrifying text. But it’s also a huge credit to the talented Sedos cast and their director, Chloe Robertson.” [Our Country’s Good, 2018, Sardines](http://www.sardinesmagazine.co.uk/reviews/review.php?REVIEW-Sedos-Our+Countrys+Good&reviewsID=3362)

“It’s easy to forget that Sedos are an amateur company – their production values and talented casts are always of such a high standard. Sedos’s production of Our Country’s Good, 30 years on from it’s Royal Court premiere, is another stunning success.” [Our Country’s Good, 2018, Fairy Powered Productions](http://fairypoweredproductions.com/our-countrys-good-review-3/?fbclid=IwAR21VRGOfvlcyQ5Aq7qHEEFm3KIJyrBUDoIn7rcO6NHpvFJVbR127yyA6jw)

**2017**

*The Drowsy Chaperone*

“This is a brilliant, brilliant show that has always deserved to be seen. In the case of this production, more so than ever.” [The Drowsy Chaperone, 2017, Sardines](http://www.sardinesmagazine.co.uk/reviews/review.php?REVIEW-Sedos-The%20Drowsy%20Chaperone&reviewsID=2838)

“The Drowsy Chaperone may be categorised as an amateur level production, but it didn’t show. The quality of this production was fantastic and truly entertaining.” [The Drowsy Chaperone, 2017, London Theatre 1](https://www.londontheatre1.com/reviews/review-the-drowsy-chaperone-bridewell-theatre/)

“I feel as if I am constantly saying this about Sedos, but they really have got amateur theatre right and the Drowsy Chaperone is yet another example of this.” [The Drowsy Chaperone, 2017, Musical Theatre Musings](http://musicaltheatremusings.co.uk/drowsy-chaperone-sedos)

Little Women The Musical

“The beautiful set design for Sedos’ production, the sheer talent of those playing the March sisters and the clever direction means that I took this award.” Little Women The Musical, 2017, Musical Theatre Musings (best amateur production of 2017)

http://musicaltheatremusings.co.uk/2017-roundup

“On realising that I was going to watch an amateur production I embarrassingly didn’t have high hopes for this production of Little Women the Musical – however, within the first few lines, I was proven very wrong. The Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society – better known as Sedos – are an amateur company who I now realise deliver professional standard productions.” Little Women The Musical, 2017, London Theatre 1

https://www.londontheatre1.com/reviews/review-little-women-bridewell-theatre/

Frankenstein 

“Watching \[Jonathon] Cooper’s character progression and journey throughout the whole show was, I felt, a master class in acting.” Frankenstein, 2017, Sardines

http://www.sardinesmagazine.co.uk/reviews/review.php?REVIEW-Sedos-Frankenstein&reviewsID=3004

“What is immediately apparent is that the ‘stars’ of this show are the designers.” Frankenstein, 2017, London Theatre 1

https://www.londontheatre1.com/reviews/review-frankenstein-bridewell-theatre/

“As always, Sedos deserve top marks for their production values.” Frankenstein, 2017, Remote Goat

https://www.remotegoat.com/uk/review/13608/intense-production-of-horror-classic/

Priscilla Queen of the Desert

“A quick exit-poll on the audience provided comments such as 'exuberant', 'brilliant', 'didn't want it to end' and 'you'll regret not seeing it.' My favourite has to be 'very pink and gay, but the best kind of gay.' Congratulations to Director / Costume Designer Angus Jacobs, Musical Director Ryan Macaulay and the whole creative team. It might not be as glittery or explosive as a big-budget West End version but it's just as fabulous.” Priscilla Queen of the Desert, 2017, Sardines

http://www.sardinesmagazine.co.uk/reviews/review.php?REVIEW-SEDOS-Priscilla%20Queen%20of%20the%20Desert%20-%20the%20Musical&reviewsID=3051t End version but it's just as fabulous.

“Overall, then I guess it’s pretty obvious I enjoyed Priscilla Queen of the Desert. Sedos have put together and delivered a first-rate show that is fun with a capital ‘F’ and entertaining with a capital ‘E’ from start to finish.”Priscilla Queen of the Desert, 2017, London Theatre 1

Such Stuff As Dreams Are Made On

“I would give the show as many stars as possible and think everyone in London should see this show… I encourage, urge and plead with you to go, because I guarantee you will not have seen anything like this before. Whoever is in charge of awards that the folks at Sedos would be eligible for, book your ticket now!” Such Stuff As Dreams Are Made On, 2016, A Younger Theatre

https://www.ayoungertheatre.com/review-such-stuff-as-dreams-are-made-on-caplan-house/

“Such Stuff as Dreams are Made on is absolutely fantastic… a truly fantastic show that will play with your mind and blow you away from the moment it starts until you once more leave the building and re-enter the real world which, for a while will seem a little less colourful than it was before.” Such Stuff As Dreams Are Made On, 2016, London Theatre 1 https://www.londontheatre1.com/reviews/fantastic-such-stuff-as-dreams-are-made-on/

Reefer Madness

“I applaud Sedos for taking a risk and producing this little known show and encourage those who want to spend the night laughing at inappropriate jokes to get themselves along to the Bridewell.” Reefer Madness, 2016, Musical Theatre Musings

Whose Life Is It Anyway?

“A riveting couple of hours… this is a thought-provoking and thoroughly entertaining piece of theatre about a highly sensitive and controversial subject.” Whose Life Is It Anyway?, 2016, Sardines

One Man, Two Guv’nors

“I have seen quite a lot of Sedos productions over the last few years, and their shows are of a consistent excellent quality. They are undoubtedly a collection of extremely talented directors, actors and performers. One Man, Two Guv’nors upheld that high expectation and did not disappoint; the show was of professional standard with even the smallest parts giving consistent high quality performances.” One Man, Two Guvnors, 2016, Sardines

http://www.sardinesmagazine.co.uk/reviews/review.php?REVIEW-Sedos-One%20Man,%20Two%20Guvnors&reviewsID=2581

“Sedos is an amateur dramatic company, but the acting is easily on par with the professional show I saw previously. In fact, having seen Sedos in action before, it seems they are once again blurring the lines between professional and amateur theatre. In particular, they prove that the quality of a show is determined by those involved – and not whether anyone is getting paid.” One Man, Two Guvnors, 2016, West End Wilma

https://www.westendwilma.com/review-one-man-two-guvnors-bridewell/

Candide

“The result is an irreverent, apt, ever topical musical… it’s in excellent hands with Sedos which, as usual, achieves a near professional standard… A jolly good evening’s entertainment, then. All credit to this production and all who sail in her.” Candide, 2016, Sardines

http://www.sardinesmagazine.co.uk/reviews/review.php?REVIEW-Sedos-Candide&reviewsID=2644

“Sedos delivered the production in a classy manner with an incredibly strong cast in everything from their characterisation to music and a strong visual feast for the eyes.” Candide, 2016, Musical Theatre Musings
