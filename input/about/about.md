Sedos is an amateur company, but we strive for professional standards in both performance and production values. Read [Sedos reviews](https://sedos.co.uk/about/sedos-reviews) here. [](/about/in-the-press)

In addition, we do everything in our power to ensure everyone involved in our shows, on stage and backstage, enjoys themselves and has a good experience – we are all volunteers, after all.

All our [London auditions](https://sedos.co.uk/get-involved) are open to everyone, members and non-members, and are free to attend.

### A potted history of Sedos

Sedos stands for the Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society. The society was founded in 1905 by senior members of the stock exchange, but the membership now includes an eclectic mix from all over London.

The senior members of the stock exchange who founded Sedos in 1905 were led by Charles Dickinson and Cyril Bathurst. Their principal aims were twofold:

* To take advantage of the great variety of stage talent they saw scattered around the house, and:
* To use what was no doubt an actual extension of the virtuoso talent employed by the members on the trading floor at the time to raise funds for charity.

With the exception of brief intermissions during the two World Wars, since then the society has presented musical and dramatic productions of all kinds and in so doing raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for a variety of charities. At its height the society mounted four large-scale productions each year at the Scala Theatre attended by members of the Royal family and employed a full-time general secretary.

Some of the better-known names who performed for the society in the early stage of their careers include [Dame Anna Neagle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Neagle) (who danced in the chorus as Marjorie Robertson), [Franklin Engelmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Engelmann) of post war BBC fame, [Patricia Roc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Roc), [Guy Middleton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Middleton) and [Rosalie Crutchley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalie_Crutchley).

More recently television luminaries such as [Nicholas Parsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Parsons) and [Faye Barker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faye_Barker) have made guest appearances.
