## **Join Sedos**

Sedos is a [London amateur theatre](https://sedos.co.uk) company, bringing together people with a passion for the theatre. Spanning a range of ages, backgrounds, professions and personalities, our members enjoy a vibrant and varied Sedos life both on and off stage.

**Shows**

Whether you’re a singer, a dancer, an actor or all three, there are plentiful opportunities to tread the boards at several of London’s best fringe venues. We present a varied season every year, with large-scale musicals, cabarets, modern and classical dramas and new writing.

Our [London auditions](https://sedos.co.uk/get-involved) are free for members and non-members.

**Backstage and production**

We always strive for a professional standard, both on stage and behind. Sedos offers the chance to broaden your skills in lighting, sound design, set design, marketing, costumes, crewing and a host of other non-performance skill.

We put together regular and varied social events for our members, from play-readings to pub quizzes and karaoke nights. [Information about our socials is posted here.](https://sedos.co.uk/get-involved)

**Workshops**

To make sure our members stay at the top of their game, we regularly offer professional-standard performance workshops to improve their skills across the board.

**Our commitment to diversity**

Sedos is a founder member of [London Drama Societies](https://www.londondramasocieties.co.uk), which commits each member society to the following statement:

“Collectively, we commit to take constant steps to be more inclusive and attract members and audiences reflecting London’s diversity.

“We will identify and remove barriers to create a safe and inclusive environment. We want everyone to feel empowered to participate, on stage or off. We want stories to be told authentically.”

**Member benefits**

* Reduced ticket prices on all Sedos shows
* Reduced rate for [Sedance](https://sedos.co.uk/regular-events/sedance)

In addition, members have the right to stand for election to the trustees and management committee and to vote at General Meetings.
