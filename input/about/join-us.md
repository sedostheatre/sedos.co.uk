## **Join Sedos**

Sedos is a group of London professionals with a passion for the theatre. Spanning a range of ages, backgrounds, professions and personalities, our members enjoy a vibrant and varied Sedos life both on and off stage.

**Shows**

Whether you’re a singer, a dancer, an actor or all three, there are plentiful opportunities to tread the boards at several of London’s best fringe venues. We present a varied season every year, with large-scale musicals, cabarets, modern and classical dramas and new writing.

Sedos members are entitled to audition for all Sedos shows for free.

**Backstage and production**

We always strive for a professional standard, both on stage and behind. Sedos offers the chance to broaden your skills in lighting, sound design, set design, marketing, costumes, crewing and a host of other non-performance skill.

Our production teams are also Sedos members as are most of our backstage crews.

**Socials**

We put together regular and varied social events for our members, from play-readings to pub quizzes and karaoke nights.

**Workshops**

To make sure our members stay at the top of their game, we regularly offer professional-standard performance workshops to improve their skills across the board.

In addition, members have the right to stand for election to the trustees and management committee and to vote at General Meetings.
