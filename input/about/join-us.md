## **Join Sedos**

Sedos is a group of London professionals with a passion for the theatre. Spanning a range of ages, backgrounds, professions and personalities, our members enjoy a vibrant and varied Sedos life both on and off stage.

**Shows**

Whether you’re a singer, a dancer, an actor or all three, there are plentiful opportunities to tread the boards at several of London’s best fringe venues. We present a varied season every year, with large-scale musicals, cabarets, modern and classical dramas and new writing.

Sedos members are entitled to audition for all Sedos shows for free.

**Backstage and production**

We always strive for a professional standard, both on stage and behind. Sedos offers the chance to broaden your skills in lighting, sound design, set design, marketing, costumes, crewing and a host of other non-performance skill.

Our production teams are also Sedos members as are most of our backstage crews.

**Socials**

We put together regular and varied social events for our members, from play-readings to pub quizzes and karaoke nights.

**Workshops**

To make sure our members stay at the top of their game, we regularly offer professional-standard performance workshops to improve their skills across the board.

**Member benefits**

* Reduced ticket prices on all Sedos shows

In addition, members have the right to stand for election to the trustees and management committee and to vote at General Meetings.
