# Diversity and Inclusion
Sedos is proud to be a founder member of [London Drama Societies](https://www.londondramasocieties.co.uk/home), which commits each member society to the following statement:

>Collectively, we commit to take constant steps to be more inclusive and attract members and audiences reflecting London's diversity.
>
>We will identify and remove barriers to create a safe and inclusive environment. We want everyone to feel empowered to participate, on stage or off. We want stories to be told authentically.

## What is London Drama Societies?

In June 2020, in the wake of the death of George Floyd and the surge of the Black Lives Matter movement, Sedos published a [Commitment to Change]( https://sedos.co.uk/news/2020-06-17-black-lives-matter---taking-action?mc_cid=1e3299df0b&mc_eid=74edd08618).

Sedos then joined with representatives from the leadership of Centre Stage and Geoids Musical Theatre to discuss ways we could make conscious and concrete steps to improve diversity and inclusion in our societies.

In June 2021, London Drama Societies was publicly [launched](https://sedos.co.uk/news/2021-06-06-a-new-commitment-to-diversity-and-inclusion).

London Drama Societies' first three sets of template policies/guidelines are on Diverse Casting and Authentic Storytelling, on Equality Monitoring, and on Marketing and Outreach. These policies guide how Sedos works in these areas. The policies are all available on the London Drama Societiesâ€™ [website](https://www.londondramasocieties.co.uk/home/resources).

## Equality monitoring

In June 2021, we also launched Sedos' first equality monitoring form, which was created with London Drama Societies.

We know that, if we want to be accountable for the steps we are taking to improve our diversity, we need to be able to demonstrate if these steps deliver progress. We are committed to publishing data on our diversity at future AGMs so our members can hold us to account.
