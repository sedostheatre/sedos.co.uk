At Sedos, we understand that participating in a show can be financially challenging. Staying true to our inclusive values, we believe that socio-economic factors should never stand in the way of exceptional talent.

That’s why we offer a Financial Assistance Scheme for cast members who may not be able to take part without support. Thanks to the generosity of donors, the scheme helps cover membership and participation fees, either partially or fully, ensuring that financial constraints don’t hinder your opportunity to shine on stage.

**How the Financial Assistance Scheme works**

The fund is supported by kind donations from members and friends of Sedos, helping us provide opportunities for those in need. Rest assured, all applications for assistance are handled with complete confidentiality, and the identities of beneficiaries remain private.

**Want to donate?**

If you’d like to contribute to the Financial Assistance Scheme, you can donate by [filling in this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScK400q8HjQGP1tEelh-YF7EpzESkwT5DqPOb2YxikcjcGP-A/viewform) and making your donation directly to the Sedos bank account (details in the full policy). Your donation won’t influence casting decisions – it simply supports more people in accessing the Sedos experience. If you have any questions, please contact our Treasurer at [treasurer@sedos.co.uk](mailto:treasurer@sedos.co.uk).

**Need financial support?**

If you would like to benefit from the scheme, details of how to apply will be in the audition notice for every Sedos show. Should you be cast, a member of the team will reach out to you in confidence to discuss assistance. Please note, requesting financial support will not affect your chances of being cast.

At Sedos, we believe in making taking part possible for everyone, no matter their financial situation.
