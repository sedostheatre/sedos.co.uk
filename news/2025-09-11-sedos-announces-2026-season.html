<p><img src="/assets/bridewellpostera4-nexttonormal.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Next To Normal" /></p>
<p><strong>Everything is perfect. Nothing’s real.</strong></p>
<p><em>Next to Normal</em> is a powerful, Tony Award-winning rock musical that explores the impact of mental illness, grief and loss on a suburban family struggling to hold themselves together. The show balances searing honesty with moments of dark humour, offering a raw portrait of love, pain and the quest for a life that feels “normal.”</p>
<p>Director Jonny Harding-Cooper said: “<em>Next to Normal</em> is the perfect blend of powerful storytelling, beautiful songs and rich characters. It’s potent, heart-wrenching and resists easy answers; it leans into the irrationality of human emotions and doesn’t shy away from how unpredictable that can be. What makes it extraordinary is the way it invites us to look closer at what a family hides behind closed doors, allowing us to witness private lives from just beyond the threshold. Our approach won’t be about echoing previous versions, but about building an environment where the cast can test, question and rediscover the work for themselves.”</p>

<p><img src="/assets/bridewellpostera4-company.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Company" /></p>
<p><strong>One apartment. Countless relationships. Endless reasons to celebrate — and you’re on the guest list.</strong></p>
<p><em>Company</em> is a sharp, witty, and deeply human portrait of modern relationships, told through a kaleidoscope of vignettes that capture the joy, chaos, and heartbreak of being part of someone else’s life. Friends, lovers, exes, and almosts swirl around Bobby in a heady mix of cocktails, candour, and Sondheim’s razor-sharp score, from the blistering comedy of Getting Married Today to the aching vulnerability of Being Alive.</p>
<p>Director Emily Phillips said: &quot;<em>Company</em> is a dream show as a director who is also a musician because it blurs the line between dramatic storytelling and musical storytelling, giving the opportunity to shape every emotional beat through both staging and music. I couldn’t be more excited to work with this fantastic team to give audiences a new lens to appreciate this poignant and hilarious show through.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Numbers make sense. People do not. This play is about that.</strong></p>
<p>The neighbours’ dog shows up dead in their front garden. Fifteen-year-old Christopher Boone is determined to find out what happened through logical detective-work. But Christopher’s investigation uncovers more than he bargains for and leads him onto a journey outside his carefully ordered world.</p>
<p>Director Alice Bennett said: &quot;As an autistic person, <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em> has always felt personal to me. The show is sharp, moving, and unlike any other play you’ll see on stage. We want this production to be dynamic and bring the audience into Christopher’s world through sound, lighting and movement. I’m so excited to be a part of bringing it to the Sedos stage!&quot;</p>

<h4 id="loves-labours-lost-bridewell-theatre-15-19-september-2026">Love's Labour's Lost | Bridewell Theatre | 15-19 September 2026</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/bridewellpostera4-loveslabourslost.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Love's Labour's Lost" /></p>
<p><strong>A sun-drenched, contemporary musical adaptation about love, language and letting go.</strong></p>
<p>Love’s Labour’s Lost is a sun-drenched musical that reimagines Shakespeare’s comedy as a bittersweet rock musical set at a university college reunion. Alex Timbers and Michael Friedman have combined pop-rock bangers, outrageous gags, and plenty of nods to the original.</p>
<p>Featuring a riot of vows, disguises, and romance gone wrong – the King and his friends renew a vow they made when they graduated to avoid all pleasures and all women. That plan unravels when the Princess and her companions arrive. This production will question what it means to promise something, and what it means to break it.  Smart, sexy, and gloriously silly, this is Shakespeare like you’ve never seen him before.</p>
<p>Director Owen Thomas James said: &quot;<em>Love’s Labour’s Lost</em> has always been my favourite play. It strikes such a charming balance between sarcastic wit and emotional poignancy, and naturally lends itself to musical accompaniment. This contemporary adaptation makes Shakespeare’s delightful comedy accessible for everyone, with a high energy pop-rock score that pokes fun at the original language and supercharges the silliness. I am absolutely delighted to be directing this for Sedos, who have a strong appetite for bold re-imaginings of the Bard. This is going to be luxurious, laugh-out-loud funny, and deeply relatable, celebrating all of love’s absurdity in the modern world. I can’t wait to get started.&quot;</p>

<h4 id="be-more-chill-bridewell-theatre-20-24-october-2026">Be More Chill | Bridewell Theatre | 20-24 October 2026</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/bridewellpostera4-bemorechill.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Be More Chill" /></p>
<p><strong>Life is not unlike a video game. And in a video game success requires just two things: good hand-eye coordination… and a cheat code.</strong></p>
<p>Jeremy Heere is just an average nerdy teenager trying to survive his last year of high school. Bullied and mocked by his peers, and feeling let down by his recently divorced father, Jeremy wants nothing more than to fit in and be one of the cool kids.</p>
<p>That’s when he finds out about “The Squip”; a tiny supercomputer from Japan that promises to solve all his problems, make life easier, and get him everything he desires. Suddenly, he’s being invited to the coolest parties of the year, he’s celebrated in the halls, and he’s got a date with the second most popular girl in school.</p>
<p>But is being popular worth sacrificing control of your life to a supercomputer?</p>
<p>Director Miranda Evans said: &quot;<em>Be More Chill</em> is an explosion of catchy tunes and geeky video game nostalgia, with a heart that speaks to that lonely teen in all of us. In our current technological era, a story about handing over your life to a sentient supercomputer feels more resonant than ever.</p>
<p>The show found its audience online where it became a bit of a cult classic. This is where I discovered the soundtrack, and it quickly became one of my favourite shows. I am thrilled to be bringing to the Bridewell with Sedos as part of the 2026 season.&quot;</p>

<h4 id="angels-in-america-bridewell-theatre-19-28-november-2026">Angels in America | Bridewell Theatre | 19-28 November 2026</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/bridewellpostera4-angelsinamerica.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Angels in America" /></p>
<p><strong>The Tony- and Pulitzer-winning masterpiece that defined a generation. The Great Work begins...</strong></p>
<p>Tony Kushner’s <em>Angels in America</em> is a sweeping, poetic two-part epic play about love, loss, and the search for meaning at the height of the 1980s AIDS crisis. Blending piercing political insight with flights of magic and imagination – and a nostalgic nod to the music of the era – it follows a group of New Yorkers whose lives collide in moments of heartbreak, revelation, and unexpected hope. At once intimate and vast, tragic and funny, the play asks timeless questions about identity, faith, and human resilience – reminding us that even in the darkest times, there is possibility, transformation, and the promise of more life.</p>
<p>Director David Gregory said: &quot;At its heart, <em>Angels in America</em> is about love, loss, and the courage to hope – stories that speak to us all. To be trusted with re-envisioning Kushner’s masterpiece is the most thrilling challenge of my directing journey.&quot;</p>
